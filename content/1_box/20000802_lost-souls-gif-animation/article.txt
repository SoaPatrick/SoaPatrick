Title: Lost Souls Gif Animation

Text: [{"content":{"text":"You know with all those bubble-gum-love-songs out there the one that really touches me is 'Nothing Compares 2 U' from Sinead O'Connor (I get wet eyes when I see the music clip). Oh, listen to her new song 'No Mans Women' once, great song:)\n\nHow do you like the countdown at the top? Cool huh:) Took me a while to get it right (as you might have witnessed yesterday)\n\nOn the official 'Lost Souls' page, I found a cute Winona gif-animation with 4 Winona pics. There's nothing new about 'Autumn in NY' so I have to seek for other stuff.\n\n'Larissa' made a cute page long ago but I always forgot to make a link, so here it is (finally) sorry about that 'Larissa'. The page is very basic but I love to read her updates everyday (Oh and the 'quote' sections is cool)"},"id":"66e75906-360b-4ed9-8a6f-d44d0bd00883","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
