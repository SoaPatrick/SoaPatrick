Title: Winona Double?

Text: [{"content":{"text":"Ok, this is it, the last day of my summer vacation. What does that mean? Well, the updates will come a bit later and it might happen that I won't be able to update the page once or twice.\n\n'Jim Reece' took a close look at this pic and found something interesting. Both women look like Winona (for me the right one is Noni, but the one on her knees looks like Winona from 'Reality Bites'). Does anyone know more about this pic? Thanks to 'Jim' for letting me know:)\n\nDon't forget to submit your movie for the 'movie idea' (Jim Reece already submitted his idea)"},"id":"b175deef-ca8f-4a50-adc1-f33586d9cbe2","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
