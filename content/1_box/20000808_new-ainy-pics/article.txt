Title: New AINY Pics

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"A bit more than two days till 'Autumn in New York' hits theatres and still, I'm amazed, there is nothing big about this movie on the internet. I even say that I've never witnessed such quietness for a movie before on the net. Maybe this will change now (hopefully, if MGM wants to make some money)\n\nIt is quiet but still, 'Delyar' found some new 'Autumn in NY' pics. Thanks a lot 'Delyar' I hope MGM will release more stuff soon."},"id":"ea92fbb0-792d-4e0f-a32f-cb9a08e7b0aa","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
