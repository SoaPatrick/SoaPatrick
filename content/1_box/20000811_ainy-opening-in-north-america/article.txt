Text: [{"content":{"text":"Yesterday was a strange day for me, everything was out of order and that's why I couldn't update the page (there was nothing new anyway)\n\nOk, guys, this is it, the day (one of the days) has come. 'Autumn in New York' is opening in North America today and I expect a lot of discussions on the board tomorrow:) Just one advise, please try to avoid spoilers or if you use spoilers try to make a warning. Not everyone has seen the movie yet:) Thanks.\n\nHere is a page where you can download new clips and an interview from 'E!'. Thanks to 'Sue':) Btw a lot predict an opening in the area of $8 million, we'll see:)"},"id":"5e6199ef-fda6-4259-b14a-801a3bf51c73","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
