Text: [{"content":{"text":"I'm sure you are asking yourself where the daily updates are he promised us. Well, I had a lot of stuff to do for school over the weekend, I also needed a break and there was nothing new anyway:)\n\nI wish I could update something today but there's nothing, NOTHING:)) That means that I will go back to my biology book and continue with learning (btw I HATE biology:))\n\nFor all the fans out there who get the German TV-channel RTL: They will air the 'Larry Sanders Show' with Winona on September 5th on 1:30 am (check your TV-magazine). Thanks to 'Chou':) I suggest you also watch the new 'Simpsons' and 'Futurama' episodes that day on PRO7:) Although the German 'Futurama' voices sound horrible."},"id":"778d861b-dbc3-4056-803d-953bd23bc11f","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
