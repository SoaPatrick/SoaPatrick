Text: [{"content":{"text":"We're back on the new server. The usual address is also working perfectly, the only thing which seems dead right now is my mail server. So if you sent me a mail yesterday or today, I didn't receive it and won't receive it today. If it's urgent, mail me to MistaG@gmx.net. I'll let you know when the other one is working again:)\n\nWhat's new today? Well, 'Mark' from the newsgroup found something very interesting on E! Online. Check out the article below. This is just ridiculous. Thanks again 'Mark' and please give me some time to write back. I'm very busy right now:)\n\nOh, and they put up the 'Autumn In New York' Poster here in Basel, woohoo:) That means soon I'm gonna see another Noni movie in Theatres:)"},"id":"9c85b8bc-6615-4c56-9a2c-6136e4c04e2e","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
