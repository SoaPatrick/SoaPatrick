Text: [{"content":{"text":"Ok I'm back and the old e-mail address is working again ( MistaG@the-darths.com ) but it seems that I can't get the countdown at the top make working. Needs a bit more time. (fixed it now) The counters, on the other hand, should work just fine and if they don't then it's not because of me:)\n\n'Mark' has sent me a great wallpaper he made out of some 'Autumn in New York' pics. It really looks great on my desktop Mark, thanks a lot:) (btw use it with black background:))\n\n'Herv\u00e9' found the Tatoo Winona has on an 'Autumn in New York' pic. Thanks a lot 'Herv\u00e9':) I found then another one from 'Autumn in New York', look at her left arm, it's pretty small.\n\nTomorrow is a big day, you can look forward to the 'Shoop Shoop Song' music video from Cher in excellent quality (30mb, Mpeg) So see you tomorrow:)"},"id":"21e2019e-7af8-498c-bdac-f8cde7e6e367","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
