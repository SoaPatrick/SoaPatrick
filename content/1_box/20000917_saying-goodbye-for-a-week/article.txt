Title: Saying Goodbye For A Week

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"It's time to say goodbye for a week now:( I'll probably be hanging around on the board sometimes but I don't have the power to update the page in the next week. As most of you know I already did those exams 6 months ago but I didn't pass them (it was a sad time) but this time I've learned more and better so chances are very good that I'll pass them this time so wish me all luck :))\n\nI won't go without something:) Here's a nic gif-animation from 'Haegar'. A blinking Winona, just look at it for a few seconds then you'll see it:) Thanks a lot 'Haegar'"},"id":"557e100e-23d7-445c-85b6-b19feadeb534","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
