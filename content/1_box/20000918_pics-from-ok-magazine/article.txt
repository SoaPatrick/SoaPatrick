Text: [{"content":{"text":"I know that I said that I won't update the page anymore till Saturday (well maybe Friday) but that was before I got those amazing new pics from 'Delyar' (from the new OK magazine) which I thought you just have to see:) Thanks a bunch 'Delyar' and also for the luck:)\n\nOn the newsgroup there was a discussion about 'Boys', that there was supposed to be a nude scene from Noni, I asked for proof and he gave me this interesting article. Thanks a lot 'Red Squirrel':)\n\nI suggest you all (the ones who haven't) download the Cher music video 'Shoop Shoop Song' this week cause I will take it down (needs to much space). So here is the URL again:)"},"id":"9f85c1be-88a3-41bd-bf12-b18708a44caf","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
