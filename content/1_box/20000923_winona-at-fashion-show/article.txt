Text: [{"content":{"text":"Damn, it's good to be back! Yes you heard right I'm back and in a good mood as well (at least till tomorrow morning, when we get the results). I'll tell, I'm so glad that it's over. On Monday evening I was in such a bad mood cause the biology and chemistry exams didn't go as planned but from Tuesday on everything went great:) Now let's all cross fingers again for tomorrow:) Now I wanna thank all of you guys who wished me luck (and still do) it really helped:) Thanks\n\nOk enough babbling about me let's focus on some new Noni pics 'Delyar' sent me yesterday. Those were taken on September 18th in NY (at a fashion show) and take a look at the third pic, doesn't this guy look a lot like Andy Kaufman? Thoughts? Thanks a lot 'Delyar':)\n\nI will focus on the 'Reality Bites' vidcaps in the next 2 days and expect them on Sunday or (if the exam results turn out not so good) on Monday. So 'Mark', (if you're reading this) please hold the links back till Monday.\n\nI will also take down the 'Shoop Shoop Song' music clip cause it needs to much space. It will return some day yes."},"id":"de5b0901-1b9f-4c07-aedc-70a0db8c91d7","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
