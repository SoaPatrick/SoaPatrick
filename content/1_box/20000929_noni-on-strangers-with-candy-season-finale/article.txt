Title: Noni on Strangers with Candy Season Finale

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"Hehehe, I just received 4 tickets for a preview screening of 'Autumn in New York' this Sunday And I didn't have to pay something, life is good.\n\n'Zuko' from the board found out that 'Noni' will appear on the season finale of 'Strangers with Candy' (this Monday). Thanks a lot 'Zuko'. Click on the link below to take a look at the commercial (really bad quality) and if someone could tape it and digitize it so that we can all take a look at it (we European) that would be just great:)\n\n'Delyar' and 'Sandro' have some new pics they sent me:) The first one is a 'smoke' collage from Sandro and the second is a Japanese 'Heathers' poster (also from Sandro) and then we have lots of new public pics from 'Delyar'. Thanks a lot to both of you:)"},"id":"d6542cf4-bc10-40cf-9a0e-674c2b2cb40e","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
