Text: [{"content":{"text":"I finally bought 'Edward Scissorhands' on DVD and I'm gonna watch it tonight, yes:))) It took us 4 weeks to get it here in Switzerland, damn we're slow:))\n\n'Catharsis' made a wonderful clip with different pics fading into each other. You can download it right here and I hope this wasn't his last work. Keep them coming 'Catharsis' and thanks a lot:))\n\nFor tomorrow's update, I have to install my scanner again cause the new 'Cinema' is out here with an article about 'Autumn in New York' and a horrible review so come back tomorrow:)) (oh and a special pic also)"},"id":"1e8bbbe9-ff66-41af-aed4-7b2d9c2beba0","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
