Title: Lost Souls Clips

Text: [{"content":{"text":"Yesterday was the season finale of 'Strangers with Candy' and I REALLY hope someone taped it and is gonna digitize it now:) I'm dying to see this, I'm only hearing good things about it (especially about Noni).\n\nI took a look at the official 'Lost Souls' page and was surprised to see a new design, well there is a small clip and a few new pics (low quality). Here is the link to the clip, some possession scenes are cut together.\n\n- ~~Possession clip \\[hi-res, 5mb\\]~~\n- ~~Possession clip \\[low-res, 2mb\\]~~\n\nAt 'Yahoo' movies I also found some new pics which are great. I love the one with Ben Chaplin and Janusz:)."},"id":"09e184c3-e086-4409-92d0-f03b41169f39","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
