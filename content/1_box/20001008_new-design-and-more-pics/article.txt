Title: New Design and more pics

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"Well well, a new design out of nowhere:) hehe didn't see that coming huh?:) Well so far everybody seems to like a lot more than version 2.0 and it probably will stay but I have to change a few things first till it's absolutely perfect (in my eyes). One thing that wonders me is that no one will miss the name 'For Your Eyes Only' mmmm, well I will miss it for sure:)\n\nAs I told you yesterday, here comes the pics action:) The first public pic is from 'Linh' (very lovely pic). The other public pics are all from 'Delyar'. The color pics are from 'Naim' and 'David' and then there's also a new Fan-Art pic from 'Sandro'. Thanks a lot 'Linh', 'Delyar', 'Naim', 'David' and 'Sandro' :)\n\n\u00a0**[Lot's of 'Walk of Fame' pics](http:\/\/www.ezuma.com\/photos.html?rnd=1007.175715.438859.301)**\u00a0\u00a0'Delyar' found this site with lots of pics from the 'Walk of Fame' but they all have this dumb logo on it. I'm gonna try something: start a corporation with them so I get the bigger version without the Logo, but this might be expensive but I'll try it. Thanks a lot anyway 'Delyar':)\n\n(if the search engine appears, just type in 'Winona Ryder')\n\n'Niall' found a site where moviegoers voted for 'Lost Souls' and it gets great reviews so far but let's wait to see some more before we celebrate:)) Thanks a lot 'Niall':)\n\n- \u00a0**[Early 'Lost Souls' Reviews](http:\/\/www.moviefone.com\/pageboy5.cgi?TP:MovieURev+DB:1+FP:MovieAA+FR:2+MVID:7891+UID:30A343939338+QD:today+PCNT:2)**"},"id":"2a622ff1-9179-45bc-b753-feb144ec47db","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
