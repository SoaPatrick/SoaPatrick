Text: [{"content":{"text":"The updates these days get bigger and bigger, thank god I have now enough space on this table. Talking about space, if the pics will float in like this in the next half year I'm gonna have a hard disk problem. I have 200mb on this server which I share with 'Chris' and I don't know how long it's gonna take till it's full. Have to search for a solution:)\n\nMore pics from the 'Walk of Fame' WOW:) 'Delyar' and 'Linh' both found some more pics. There's a pic that worries me a bit, is she trying to kiss Anthony on that pic? Anyway, thanks a lot 'Delyar' and 'Linh':)\n\n- \u00a0~~Walk of Fame Pics~~\n\n'Mark' takes interviews to a new level:) Instead of a transcript, he just sends me an mp3 file with the interview:) Thank you very much for that 'Mark' and quality is great btw:) Oh the interview is about 'Lost Souls':)\n\n- \u00a0~~'Lost Souls' interview~~\n\n'Linh' also found an article on 'Canoe.ca' about 'Lost Souls'. There's way more buzz about LS than there was about 'Autumn in NY'. Is this a good sign? I don't know. Thanks a lot 'Linh'\n\n- ~~'Lost Souls' article~~"},"id":"d9ef6eb7-cc7d-40a7-a8cc-8da1f0e46d76","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
