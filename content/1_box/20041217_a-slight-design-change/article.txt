Title: A slight design change

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"Hey everyone... MistaG or let's say Patrick here (changed my name back to my real name). As you might have noticed, new people are updating the page now too, that's because I decided to step down and let others do the work, people who have more time and might be more into it than I am. But I'm still in the back and sometimes even working on stuff which brings me to the reason of today's update.\n\nAGCN v8 has been changed VERY slightly, I gave up on tables (people who create webpages know what I mean) and created the whole thing pretty much on CSS. I will do the galleries too very soon (already working on it) but for that, I probably have to shut them down once in a while to go into testing mode. The reason I changed it is to make it more professional and also to easily change the look of the page (in the future several AGCN themes might come)\n\nOh and before I leave again and let the others make their job..."},"id":"7a93d74d-f658-4f36-81da-52ceb38a8e18","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
