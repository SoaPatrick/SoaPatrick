Title: "W" Essential

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"ok, correct me if I'm wrong, but I was checking the B\/W gallery and I found out that the \"W\" magazine scans were not there....ok. I think it\u00b4s essential in any Winona's fansite to have those amazing scans which meant so much for fans and her (who could forget that t-shirt !!, hehe). So I uploaded them in the b\/w gallery. I am sure the scans belong to GoDrex, but tell me if I'm wrong.\n\nI took advantage and I uploaded some more pics in that gallery. There are some great scans by corky, two covers I retouched and cleaned, and some more pics people have been posting during these months. I\u00b4m sorry for not giving credit to all of them, but I REALLY do not know who scanned\/posted them. I\u00b4m sorry!!!.\n\n- [Go and see the gallery!!](https:\/\/agcn.soapatrick.com\/pictures\/categories.php?cat_id=2&page=12)"},"id":"361c64cd-3a10-423a-8808-a5fccc9aca7e","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
