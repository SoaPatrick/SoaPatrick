Title: AGCN goes WordPress

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"I've been sick for the last 2 weeks but yesterday I put in a work session and freed AGCN from its dependency through the invision board. AGCN now works completely independent using the new WordPress 1.5 (used here on the-soap as well) to create updates.\n\nI'd say its a big step for AGCN, not only is the archive now also on AGCN and features a search engine, now AGCN supports RSS which is a first among Winona fan pages (and maybe among fan pages worldwide, not sure there)."},"id":"1b6918e7-c3b8-46a5-8fa9-c2c56fac67c8","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
