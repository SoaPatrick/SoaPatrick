----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"Today we have some good and some bad news, first the good news. The word is out that Winona will star in the movie '**O Jerusalem**'. Here the info from M&C Movies.\n\n> Winona Ryder and Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui ( \"Three Kings\" ) will star in \"O Jerusalem\" for director Elie Chouraqui ( \"Harrison's Flowers\" ). The film, based on the book by Domenica Lapierre and Larry Collins about the creation of the state of Israel, tells the story of a young Palestinian and his Jewish friend and the tragic events that separate them. Filming is scheduled to begin April 10 in Greece. Commea Cinema and the French version of Yahoo are both reporting this.\n\nThe bad news is that it seems '**A Scanner Darkly**' gets pushed back to March 2006 according to movies.com.\n\n> The animation in the first trailer for Richard Linklater's trippy flick showcases its groundbreaking animation, but maybe coordinating a huge team of digital artists is one reason why the Philip K. Dick adaptation has been pushed back to March 2006. Bummer \u2014 we were looking forward to seeing it in September.\n\nThanks to **Rundstedt2001** for the find."},"id":"5e57e0d8-5c08-48c0-a325-43a3fdf3c1c6","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
