Text: [{"content":{"text":"Pre-Production on the next (or more precisely the very first) experimental movie has begun. Shooting will probably take place around 15th\/16th October and with very detailed pre-production, it shouldn't take long to edit the movie together.\n\nThe movie will probably run around 1 or 2 minutes and is called (as the title of this journal entry already suggests) \"Slippery When Wet\". We keep you posted on the status of this project."},"id":"e0595695-1800-4823-b40d-0d4004df9a56","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
