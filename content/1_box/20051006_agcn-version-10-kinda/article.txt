Title: AGCN Version 10, kinda...

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"I know that its not 100% a new version, but it's a big enough change upon version 9 that I though this one deserves it's own number :) It's not completely done yet (some tweaking is still necessary) but I wanted to get it out and finish it later because I worked the last 2 days full force on it.\n\nBut what exactly is new? Well, we finally have a contact form and now I don't have to worry about spam. All mails written to me through the contact form will really make it to my mailbox (this wasn't exactly the case before). Another thing is the separate archive which was the reason to get rid of the F.A.Q. (just not enough space on that navigation bar). I think that's mainly it, other small changes you will notice yourself :)\n\nBut what big things have to be done (the bigger than tweaking things). Well the obvious one now is of course the Bio (first thing tomorrow on my todo list). Then I have to go through all the updates and work out something for the thumbnails (no border around them yet but a small dotted border below them). And finally I'm thinking of adding a Poll on the left side, might be fun to :)\n\nThat's it for now... will lean back and enjoy the latest episode of Lost very soon..."},"id":"e6b33e38-bea0-42fb-92dd-b850f95388aa","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
