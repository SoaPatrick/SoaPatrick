Thanks a lot to **Rundstedt2001** for this great find :)\n\nIf you check the pictures, you will notice (maybe you noticed it during the last week already) that I worked over the picture gallery to make it suited to v10. It's not completely done yet (this has been said WAY too often on AGCN recently) but I will finish the last touches this weekend (all that is left I think is the e-card part). If there are any bugs, please let me know and use the ~~contact form~~. And please be patient about replies. I've been VERY busy this week."},"id":"9db7f7b8-1296-44dd-ae16-9e081951a3cb","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
