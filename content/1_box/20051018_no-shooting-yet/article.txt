Text: [{"content":{"text":"As you might have figured out, no shooting of 'Slippery When Wet' has taken place yet. There are two reasons for it, #1 I was working very intensely on (link: https:\/\/agcn.soapatrick.com text: AGCN target: _blank) recently where I created several themes for the new version 10. Reason #2 is that we decided to wait a bit longer and then shoot the movie with the newly purchased DV camera. We still might shoot it earlier but right now the plan is to wait.\n\nSo I keep you posted whenever something new about 'Slippery When Wet' comes up :)"},"id":"189987b0-5a93-4c6c-9dbd-2f4e045cb66e","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
