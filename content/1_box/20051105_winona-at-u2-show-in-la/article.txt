Title: Winona at U2 Show in LA

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"Apparently, Winona was at the U2 show in Los Angeles on Tuesday. It's been well known that Winona and Bono have a good relationship with each other (Winona was in a video clip that was played during 'Desire' in concerts, it was in U2's Zoo-tour). I wouldn't expect pictures from this event but I still thought it's worth mentioning.\n\n- ~~U2 gives L.A. band a taste of Vertigo~~\n\nAlso a fun but late Winona quote about Halloween :)\n\n> In high school, I dressed up as every James Bond girl."},"id":"c7095f94-663a-4acb-9436-f00ef5b1b1ac","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
