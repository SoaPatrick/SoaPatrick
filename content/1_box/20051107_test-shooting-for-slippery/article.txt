Title: Test Shooting for Slippery

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"Today the test shooting took place, which means the \"movie\" got shot real fast and later cut together real fast as well to get a sense for it and also to find out what has to be improved for the real shooting which will take place on Wednesday. Sound recording for it won't be done until next week when the new mic will be purchased. But early test footage looks promising (well for what the movies intentions are :p )"},"id":"43508d96-ffc7-46cd-90ee-f26a937e0ce2","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
