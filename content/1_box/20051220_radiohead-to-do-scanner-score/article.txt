Title: Radiohead to do "Scanner" Score?

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"There's a rumor floating around that the famous band Radiohead might redo the score for the upcoming movie \"A Scanner Darkly\". Here's the snippet from ~~twitchfilm.net~~:\n\n> \"I have a friend who is an animator on Richard Linklater's A SCANNER DARKLY. I thought you might be interested in this scoop.\n> \n> The movie is doing very well in test screenings, but the #1 complaint audiences have is with the score. So I can only tell you this anonymously, but the producers have approached RADIOHEAD about doing a new score for the film and it looks like everything is going to go through. So in addition to an awesome animated Phillip K. Dick film, we will have a brand new Radiohead score to look forward to. as far as I know, this is the first time Radiohead has ever done a score for the film. While this is still a \"rumor\" at this time, I would give it a 99% accuracy rating at this point.\n> \n> Also, I've seen the new trailer for the film and it is absolutely outstanding. It should be hitting the web any time now.\"\n\nthe whole thing can be read here: ~~twitchfilm.net\/archives\/004469.html~~"},"id":"5b2e95e9-cb30-4d6a-b53a-60598a2a448b","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
