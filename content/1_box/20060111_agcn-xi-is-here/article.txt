Title: AGCN XI is here...

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"It's out, something I've been working on since November finally made it public. I'm really happy with how it turned out and I think some changes that have been done are for the better, like having the navigation now vertical and not horizontal anymore, letting me add more sections now without having to worry about the width of the navigation bar.\n\nBut it's still buggy on a lot of things but I wanted to get it out and finish the last touches in public, and maybe you guys spot something as well, if so please don't hesitate and contact me :) Changes to the page can be watched in the ~~Change Log~~\n\nso now I let you guys enjoy this new version which now has only 2 styles to choose from, a dark and intense version (for the people who want white text on dark background) and the default one, a bright light one. Enjoy..."},"id":"f19c9709-2554-4393-9c60-b000a31f9755","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
