Tonight's premiere will go through as planned, but sans press line. We'll be seeing Darwin tomorrow and will have a review up as soon as we can. There's also a Darwin awards party tonight, but with cast and crew in mourning, we imagine it probably won't be much of a party, despite the fact that Metallica is scheduled to play in a room the size of my black faux-crocodile handbag.\n\nTo see more pictures from the premiere go here.\n\n- (link: https:\/\/agcn.soapatrick.com\/pictures\/categories.php?cat_id=213 text: The Darwin Awards Movie Premiere pictures target: _blank)"},"id":"a7054725-e04e-4f0f-8140-d804eea45199","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
