Title: Winona on RES cover

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"Winona is featured on the January\/February issue of the RES magazine. The issue also has a whole article on \"A Scanner Darkly\" and its complex animation process. According to ChrisB, the issue has surprisingly lots of Winona pictures. Well, hopefully, some scans will soon appear on the net somewhere. Thanks a lot, ChrisB for this cool find and the info."},"id":"57fdfa6b-ba3b-4d56-b82b-06d81b990d18","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
