Title: Big RES Mag Pictures

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"After **ChrisB** took some photos for us from the newly released RES magazine with Winona on the cover, NTN found the magazine as well and scanned the cover and the picture inside for us. Thanks a lot to both of you guys. I did some working on the cover scan from NTN, cut out the text, used some filters and worked manually on it for quite some time to reduce some graphics mishaps. I think the final result is pretty good, so enjoy it :)"},"id":"5a1b5d3d-ab3c-4a72-a64f-227354af4b10","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"},{"content":{"columns":2,"lightbox":"true","align":"content","images":["res-002.jpg","res-003.jpg"]},"id":"17ed74a0-9e68-460b-92ee-32b27e83000f","isHidden":false,"type":"gallery"},{"content":{"text":"Btw we here at AGCN never ever tagged pictures because they simply do not belong to us and I'm still surprised to see other pages doing exactly that, even though the photos were taken by photographers they don't know and they didn't pay for pictures either. So this whole accusation game of 'stealing' pictures is kind of ridiculous. Just something I had to mention."},"id":"3886707e-0e52-488c-ae35-b03b3a6ec591","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
