----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"Filmmaker Magazine has an interview with \"A Scanner Darkly\" director Richard Linklater in which he talks about the making of his upcoming new movie. Thanks (any guess who it is? :p) to ChrisB. Below is a short passage from the interview, to read the whole thing, click here: (link: http:\/\/www.filmmakermagazine.com\/winter2006\/features\/schizoid_man.php text: THE SCHIZOID MAN target: _blank)\n\n> **Did your actors have much knowledge of Dick\u2019s work before they joined the project? Was Woody Harrelson, for example, a fan?**\n> \n> I don\u2019t think he \\[knew Dick\u2019s work\\], actually, but he liked the script. Winona, her dad knew Philip K. Dick. She had letters from him, and she brought a lot of knowledge to the table. Keanu is a total workhorse who did tons of research. He and I would always refer to the book and Dick\u2019s letters. I would say Woody and Rory didn\u2019t overthink it too much. Downey definitely has to dig in on an intellectual level, as does Keanu, but Winona probably had the most knowledge."},"id":"4cfe30ee-9288-40df-a554-fb30a5b801b8","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
