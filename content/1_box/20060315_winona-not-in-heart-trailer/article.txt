Title: Winona not in 'Heart' Trailer

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"A new trailer for The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things got released recently but Winona is no longer featured in it, nor is she mentioned within the trailer or at the end of it with the movie details. I'm sure she's still in the movie but that an A-List (or former A-List) actor is not mentioned is kinda weird.\n\nAnyway here's the link to the trailer (for me it only opened with iTunes, not sure what happens if you don't have it) in case you're interested, looks better than the previous very weird trailer (which was probably more off a showcase for possible studios to pick it up for distribution)\n\n- ~~The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things Trailer~~"},"id":"14ff4e1b-8425-41ec-87e0-14e22892b6b6","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
