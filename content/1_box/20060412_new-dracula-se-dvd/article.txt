Well, it would be nice to finally get one because as far as I know there's only the Superbit Version. Here's the part about Dracula from the interview, for the whole thing (also some Apocalypse Now mention) go here: ~~Coppola's DVD Producer Preparing for HD~~\n\n> For the past 15 months, Aubry and his team have been working on the upcoming special edition DVD release \u2014 Apocalypse Now: The Complete Dossier, a sort of \u201ckitchen sink\u201d version of an Apocalypse Now DVD.\n> \n> It will include both the original and Redux versions of the film, as well as a wealth of new documentaries that dive deep into the editing, the sound, the music and other aspects of the film\u2019s production.\n> \n> Aubry is filming some of the bonus features in high-def, for this and for another project, Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, which will also include a special \u201cart student\u201d viewing option.\n> \n> \u201cWhenever moments in the film appear that have interesting references to art, a button will appear,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can select it, and the film will stop, and they\u2019ll see the storyboard or the painting the setting is based on.\u201d"},"id":"1a293df4-f404-44b4-bf50-124ce03349aa","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
