But with recent changes in my personal life and with the development of fan pages I realized it\u2019s for the best to step back because I don\u2019t have the energy and the will anymore.\n\nIn the next few days\/weeks I will look back on how AGCN has changed my life in the past 2400 days. The first question you guys might have is what happens with the picture gallery. Well, it will stay online for now but I plan to take it down by the end of the year. So this should be enough time to get what you want before it\u2019s gone.\n\nmore later\u2026"},"id":"d6d1e9b8-0476-4ca1-8226-3f3f76996218","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
