It\u2019s based on the font Fight This from the Fight Club movie, \nwhere the name of course comes from too, with some alteration to the \nfont to make it nicer looking. I was always happy with the end result \nbut of course something was always missing, there\u2019s no real logo there \nbut just the text. Well now one could say well a text can be a logo too \nbut for me I had to have an icon, a symbol so I went back to the drawing\n board and tried to come up with a symbol for the-soap.com<\/p>"},"id":"0c0a7035-5a45-482f-9e1d-559c5111bed1","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["logo-v2.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"true","ratio":"","crop":"false","align":"default"},"id":"bdc37eeb-80f3-4155-bbcc-593db176abce","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>This brings us to 2005 I think where I looked at soap bubbles and \nthought this might represend soap bubbles the most and created this \nsimple circles logo. But now the nice font from version 1 didn\u2019t fit to \nthis logo so I tried all kinds of different font types for this logo but\n none really pleased me to make it a definite package with the circles \nbut I sticked to the circles. I used this for quite some time with a \nsimple arial font for the and for different designs but the longer I \nlooked at it the more I started to long for a change and for something \nnicer looking with stronger lines because I had problems with the thin \nlines on darker backgrounds and I couldn\u2019t use different colors on the \nlogo because of them.<\/p>"},"id":"9e8e0461-bc5a-4b0f-987f-adaeaff5da6a","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["logo-v3.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"true","ratio":"","crop":"false","align":"default"},"id":"5899e851-47d8-4c69-bf21-a46bace63b15","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>So in 2007 I was watching a Maroon 5 music video when at the end of \nthe clip a plane flies into the sunset and the clouds make this swoosh \nand I knew that there lies my new logo. So I had my stronger lines and \nit just popped more than the old logo but I still had a color problem \nand a font problem and further down the road I realized it looked a lot \nlike the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marware.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">marware<\/a> logo. But at least I could explain where my logo comes from, just watch the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sAebYQgy4n4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=216s\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">video<\/a>.\n Anyway So I had my swoosh logo and kinda liked it more than the bubbles\n circle logo but then there wasn\u2019t a really good connection to the word \nsoap, it wasn\u2019t a soap bar, it wasn\u2019t a soap bubble it was just a \nswoosh. I always saw it as soap water in a washing mashine :p So I stuck\n with it but I played around with it.<\/p>"},"id":"28111479-2404-4e86-82fa-03bb783c4b60","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["logo-v4.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"true","ratio":"","crop":"false","align":"default"},"id":"ea371d81-3533-4c52-ae01-d8e64d395dfa","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>In 2009, after months of playing around with it I had something that \ncombined some elements that I loved into a new improved logo. I finally \nhad the font, I had more colors and it looked really nice, even though \nit started to look like a blue tennis ball, but I liked it a lot and \nit\u2019s the reason it stayed on the-soap.com for so long as the only thing \nvisible. But putting the logo back to a simple black and white one \nturned out to be difficult and I still haven\u2019t successfully done that. \nThis is the reason that I decided to ditch this one and come up with \nsomething new once again.<\/p> <p>This brings me to today. I\u2019ve done quite a lot of brainstorming and I\n realized that with the name soap there aren\u2019t a lot of possibilities. \nWe either go with soap bubbles (like I used in the past), go with a soap\n bar (which is kinda hard to make it destinguish from just a retangle \nblock) or go with something more company wise, like soap company, a \ncompany that produces soap. These are the things I think it comes down \nto, and while I have these ideas I always look for inspiration online \nwhere I found one extremely cool logo but now it has become hard to come\n up with something that doesn\u2019t resemble that specific logo (it\u2019s a \nbubble logo as well).<\/p> <p>I would really love to use the first logo for the font again, but \nthen I\u2019d have to come up with an icon that fits to that font, so let\u2019s \nsee where this will lead me.<\/p>"},"id":"e82138b8-0e95-4d6e-91cc-7ee499693005","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
