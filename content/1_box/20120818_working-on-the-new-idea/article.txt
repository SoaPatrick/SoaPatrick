Old: Yesterday I mentioned having a new Idea so I scribbled them on a piece of paper during work and the moment I came home I put those scribbles into digital images. Now this morning I started fresh with Illustrator and later on with Photoshop to further enhance this idea and I kinda like the result

I gave the logo some grunge stamp look and I really like where I'm going with this. There's still some work to be done, mainly with the stroke width at some places, the factory design and especially the smoke that comes out of the chimney. But when you consider that I've done that within maybe 2 to 3 hours then it looks halfdecent.

I will keep on working on that design and maybe also think of different color settings for this one, a 2 or 3 color version needs to work too and I kinda already have some ideas as to where to put them.

Or maybe I will throw the whole thing away and start with something fresh, these days it's hard to know :p
