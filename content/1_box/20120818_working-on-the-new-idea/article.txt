Now this morning I started fresh with \nIllustrator and later on with Photoshop to further enhance this idea and\n I kinda like the result<\/p>"},"id":"0215db27-b802-4e0c-beb8-94cc451f3cef","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["soap-factory.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"true","ratio":"","crop":"false","align":"default"},"id":"8b45879c-d2a9-4907-9993-32fd68f5beae","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I gave the logo some grunge stamp look and I really like where I\u2019m going with this. There\u2019s still some work to be done, mainly with the stroke width at some places, the factory design and especially the smoke that comes out of the chimney. But when you consider that I\u2019ve done that within maybe 2 to 3 hours then it looks half-decent.<\/p><p>I will keep on working on that design and maybe also think of different color settings for this one, a 2 or 3 color version needs to work too and I kinda already have some ideas as to where to put them.<\/p><p>Or maybe I will throw the whole thing away and start with something fresh, these days it\u2019s hard to know :p<\/p>"},"id":"82a92875-7b34-4282-91a8-89f68067d299","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
