Well after a day off from all I started to outline the so far decided story points from the movie I'm currently developing with a partner. There's still some blanks especially in the middle of the story but what we so far have is a basic outline and a more detailed beginning and ending with some major plot points already in place.

It looks good so far and I think we have something here to work with but it's a long way from ready to shoot. I might start to write the few scenes I'm already picturing in my head in screenplay form and in the meantime work on that middle part that needs to be filled a bit more.
