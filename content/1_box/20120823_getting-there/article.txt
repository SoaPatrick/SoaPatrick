Old: Well that was a fruitfull night yesterday. I think for 3 hours straight I was working on this with illustrator because I was so excited where it was all leading that I couldn't go to bed before I had all my ideas outthere. at 2am I was finally in bed and done, but not before I picked up work again this morning and finished it in photoshop to add some final artistic details to it.

I really really really like where I'm going with this but I don't wanna say that this is the final version, I might tinker around with it some more but for the most part I think this is it. Or maybe I won't tinker with it any longer and call this the new logo, I don't know, depends on how I like it tomorrow :p
