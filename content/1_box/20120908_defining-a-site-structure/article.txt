Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Well, it\u2019s been a hectic time recently and therefore finding time to work on those subjects has been kinda spare. Nonetheless, I found some time to come up with a definite site structure for the whole projects part and how I will handle the site navigation and everything.<\/p><p>The idea is to use the blog very excessively for it all which means there will be a category projects and under that category, I will add for each new project I will start a new category with the project's title as the category name.<\/p><p>The project page will still be a page will all the media and blog posts from the specific category on display. The tags I will use for describing each project a bit more.<\/p><p>This means that I will change the current category structure and create new ones now already. So we would have the \u2018the soap factory logo\u2019 and \u2018the soap factory web design\u2019 category.<\/p><p>As for the design, I was thinking about making a horizontal design, but the problem there is the usability aspect. People are used to scrolling vertical (I mean you have a scroll wheel on your mouse which is aligned vertically) so when a user suddenly has to scroll horizontal it feels weird and therefore people don\u2019t feel familiar and need longer to find something and scrolling up and down doesn\u2019t exist.<\/p><p>I know I wanted to create something new here instead of just the regular design structure, but I\u2019m not sure if I do something this radical.<\/p>"},"id":"bcc3a08c-c8f4-4486-8426-4acef1ca664c","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
