I like \nthe whole simple aspect of it and it just pops like I mentioned \nyesterday already. Maybe I will add the Production title below in the \nsame custom font, depends on how it looks. But either way, that font \nwith the bubbles will be the new logo for now. Until I come up with a \nlogo with a factory included that pleases me enough and can be displayed\n in various forms.<\/p>"},"id":"167fa8c3-7790-46d0-a4c1-2a08fe1a7695","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["soap-logo-simple.png"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"true","ratio":"","crop":"false","align":"default"},"id":"4edc90d4-c9b3-46a8-b24b-cf5d3b3a530c","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Talking about that whole thing, I also drew something down on paper \nyesterday at work, how I picture the future logo. I\u2019m not sure yet if \nthe frame should be rectangle or an elipse and not sure how to make the \nimage fade into the background color outside the frame but the concept I\n think should be this or in some form like this, all I need now is a \nselfmade factory with a chimney oh and a font that looks clean by \ndefault and doesn\u2019t have the worn out look, because that I can add \nmyself, but I cannot make a wornout font clean, or I haven\u2019t figured \nthat out yet, maybe I can.<\/p> <p>Now this morning I took that factory image from yesterday and \nimplemented some things to make it look like something I could see in \nthe future and I really like it. Of course the chimney is not 100% \nperfect implemented into the image and the bubbles look not bad but not \nperfect either, but I like it nontheless.<\/p>"},"id":"76b47e5e-5a2e-4737-8025-635acafa0403","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["soap-productions-drawing.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"false","ratio":"","crop":"false","align":"default"},"id":"1bea834f-f277-41d2-ba79-b0e8101868d4","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}]
