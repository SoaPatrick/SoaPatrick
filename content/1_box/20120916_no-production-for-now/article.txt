I played around with the new simple logo yesterday, I tried different font types to add the "Production" below "Soap" and no matter what font I used, it didn't look really good, it was just ok so I decided not to add "Production" to the logo and just have SOAP there with the bubbles. But like I mentioned yesterday, this is a temporary logo until I have the perfect factory and perfect font for the more complex logo.

The next step now would be to FINALLY focus on the design and I think with this logo now it should be a lot easier to come up with something. I look forward to it..
