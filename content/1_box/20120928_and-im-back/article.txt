Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>It\u2019s been some time since the last update here and I just wanna explain why. The reason is not that unlike the last few times that I simply don\u2019t have the urge or motivation to post anymore but I was simply very busy for the last few days.<\/p><p>School has started again and with a special Kick-Off Week for this semester's project where we worked for 6 days straight, there was simply no time to post updates here.<\/p><p>BUT that doesn\u2019t mean I was not doing anything, my mind always is at work at several things at once, so I will make small updates to most of the individual projects, maybe a few today.<\/p>"},"id":"50db031c-e250-46ce-add7-60269953074e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
