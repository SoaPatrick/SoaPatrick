Old: I haven't written in screenplay form for a LONG time so it was nice to actually do this again. I'm having this specific scene of the movie in my head for a long time so at one boring moment in last weeks Kick Off Week, I took out my mac and started typing, and this is the result.

I had more little moments in my head in those few moments but it's a first start. The scene itself isn't actually finished yet, there's more to come (a lot more) but it works by itself how it's written down so I decided to show it here.

As for titles, well so far I've only thought of two, and from the two I like one better.

**At The Gates of Hell**

**Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea**
