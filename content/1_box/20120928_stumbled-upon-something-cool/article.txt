Old: I know I said the Logo design process is over but I saw something which gave me new ideas for the factory logo. I never actually thought about this way of making it, including the font right into the factory. It looks cool and works perfect as a two color logo.

When I continue the design process of the logo I have to try stuff like this out, without making a 1-to-1 copy, which is what usually happens when I see something I like. But I really wanna make a logo that's my own thing so I can be proud of, just like the current (link: http://soapatrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/soap-logo-simple_v2.png text: simple one target: _blank).
