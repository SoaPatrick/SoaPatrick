I fiddled around with my sheep some more and learned how to increase the resolution of the 3D Objects to make it a lot more smoother. I also made the legs shorter, looks better now and I wanted to improve the horns/ears and the right eyelid but then the animation stopped working. So I leave it like this and if I decide to go further, I will restart from the ground up with a new sheep.
