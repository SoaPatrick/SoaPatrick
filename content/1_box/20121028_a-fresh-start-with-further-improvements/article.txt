So I worked with mirroring for the eyes to achieve better symmetry and tried to move the objects better on their axis, especially the now moving eyeballs. And finally, I added some grass to finish the whole thing. The result looks stunning (took me around an hour to render the video) but I find that by trying to achieve perfection, the sheep ended up looking not as bored as in the first try. Maybe I will play around with some angles from the head and the camera but because of the grass now, everything takes longer to render, so\u2026<\/p>"},"id":"e5478730-4cd6-4f86-ac48-2f70c5dd15e4","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
