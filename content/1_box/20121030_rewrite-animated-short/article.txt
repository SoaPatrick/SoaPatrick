Old: Well I decided to rewrite my animated short because now after working with Blender I actually wanna do that short and I think my idea with the boy and the interface is just a bit too complicated to do with blender all by myself in a realistic timeframe. Sooo.... I reduce all the complex things and try to tell a very short story with very little action but be funny. That's the goal. I have an idea but I need to flesh it out some more, and then it all starts from the top. First draw new storyboards and then turn them into a story reel and finally animate it. The center of the story is of course my newly created sheep with the bored look.
