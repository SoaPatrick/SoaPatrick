Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Well, I decided to rewrite my animated short because now after working with Blender I actually wanna do that short and I think my idea with the boy and the interface is just a bit too complicated to do with Blender all by myself in a realistic timeframe. Sooo\u2026. I reduce all the complex things and try to tell a very short story with very little action but be funny. That\u2019s the goal. I have an idea but I need to flesh it out some more, and then it all starts from the top. First, draw new storyboards and then turn them into a story reel and finally animate it. The center of the story is of course my newly created sheep with the boring look.<\/p>"},"id":"a65e5fb4-d746-43d8-a702-eee0d8223ab2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
