Old: Due to a course in school, I had to think about how to integrate social media into a business. I did this exercise with Soap Productions and created the following accounts right away (who knows if they will be available). Vimeo was created recently but now I also have a Twitter and Facebook account. I don't know when and if I will use them but I have them!

- [twitter.com/SoapProds](http://www.twitter.com/SoapProds)Â (@SoapProds)
- [facebook.com/SoapProds](http://www.facebook.com/SoapProds)

Maybe I will use them soon to promote certain projects like the Sheep movie (have to find a title for that one)
