Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I started to think about a different story for my sheep movie and currently, I\u2019m headed in a direction that is very straightforward when it comes to the whole 3-act structure. There\u2019s the <em>inciting incident<\/em> followed by p<em>lot point #1<\/em> which ends the 1st act. What follows are some obstacles and the <em>midpoint<\/em> and then the <em>plot point #2<\/em> which ends the 2nd act, then we have the <em>climax<\/em> in the 3rd act.<\/p><p>The problem I\u2019m having is plot point #2 because it shouldn\u2019t come out of nowhere. But then why use a 3-act structure for a 2-5 minutes movie? Well, I got inspired by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Knick_Knack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Knick Knack<\/a>, the Pixar short but it could be shorter and simpler and be more of a gag short with no real act structure. Well, I will keep thinking about it.<\/p>"},"id":"9b362408-baf0-4c07-82ac-52743d708746","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
