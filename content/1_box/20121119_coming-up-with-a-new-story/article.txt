Old: I started to think about a different story for my sheep movie and currently I'm headed in a direction which is very straight forward when it comes to the whole 3-act structure. There's the _inciting incident_ following by the p_lot point #1_ which ends the 1st act. What follows are some obstactles and the _midpoint_ and then the _plot point #2_ which ends the 2nd act, then we have the _climax_ in the 3rd act.

The problem I'm having is the plot point #2 because it shouldn't come out of nowhere. But then why use a 3-act structure for a 2-5 minutes movie? Well I got inspired by (link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knick_Knack text: Knick Knack target: _blank), the Pixar short but it could be shorter and simpler and be more of a gag short with no real act structure. Well I will keep thinking about it.
