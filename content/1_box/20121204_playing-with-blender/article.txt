I continue to play around with Blender and learn new things every day. I recently started to play around with stick figures and the the armature animation. And then I imported the Soap Productions Logo into Blender and played around with that a little bit.

The idea now is to have like a movie intro done with blender, there's a basic idea I'm having and I will draw storyboards first, then make a basic animation in Blender and finally add some real life details to the animation and render again (which will take a Â LOOOONG time)
