A friend of mine bought a new domain name with a cool sounding name [einbit.ch](http://www.einbit.ch). I offered him to come up with logo ideas. So when I was at work and there was nothing to do, I doodled around.

I liked the idea to transform the 1 and the b from bit into one object and I also wanted to use a pixel font type which represents the whole computer part. So I drew this 3D block with both the 1 and the b visible.

Later at home I used blender to play around with perspective and then had a 'final' product which he liked and is currently used on his page as a single image.
