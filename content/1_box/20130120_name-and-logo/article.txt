Well all this thinking about the names of each part and when I was looking for better domain names for this page, I always looked at the logo and therefor was really focused on finding something for 'Soap' when in fact this place here is called 'The Soap'. So I realized the logo has to change slightly to make it actually fit to the domain name. The 'The' was missing and so I included it and I still like it. This is something I can see on my soon to be design webpage as a logo.
