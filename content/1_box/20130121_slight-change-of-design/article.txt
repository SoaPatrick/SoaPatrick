Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Well with the recent change of the logo to add the word \u2018The\u2019 in front of \u2018Soap\u2019 I thought it was time to change the header of the page because after all, that header image didn\u2019t make much sense anymore.<\/p><p>I agree that it looks all rather bland right now, but I\u2019m working on it, I just thought a quick change and putting that logo up there made sense and the rest will follow. I\u2019m also moving towards the idea of keeping the sections Soap Factory and Soap Productions since it does kinda make sense to have the projects separated based on their status (or in this case their location). So \u2018The Soap Factory\u2019 will then be the place where a project gets finally made into something concrete and \u2018The Soap Productions\u2019 part will be where all the project will be located with a label for their current location.<\/p><p>And finally, since I\u2019ve made a promise, right back on day 1, that every time some design change occurs I will take a screenshot and post it so that I can look back and see all the different stages.<\/p>"},"id":"40cdbd78-7047-460d-973c-723b4a1f14f4","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["soapatrickone.png"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"true","ratio":"","crop":"false","align":"default"},"id":"12877272-629e-4549-a61c-c6905f677678","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}]
