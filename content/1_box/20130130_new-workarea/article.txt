Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Well, the reason for the lack of updates is that I made some changes at home. I moved the work area to another room and I now face the room and not a wall anymore, which I hope will increase the creative process, but the room is not done yet. I will paint one of the walls in a darkish red, hang some movie posters in frames up on that wall together with 4 white Styropor letters which spell the word soap, obviously. I will also have to move the whiteboard to the new room so that I can use that again.<\/p><p>I hope that beginning with next week, I will start working on this place here and create a nice little home for all my ideas.<\/p>"},"id":"af20b53d-3b1c-4653-8566-d64a127f712d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
