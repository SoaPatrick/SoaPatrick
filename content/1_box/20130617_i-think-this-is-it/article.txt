Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>After months of looking and thinking about the design of my place, this is something I really like. It\u2019s simple, it's clean, it\u2019s responsive (and I didn\u2019t do it myself). Well I did some tinkering (only slightly) and it\u2019s possible I will add some modifications in the future, but it\u2019s not my main issue. What I plan on doing now is using my just opened <a href=\"http:\/\/dribbble.com\/SoaPatrick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dribbble<\/a> account and also getting this page fully ready. Meaning when you see that new name everywhere, you see where this might be beheaded.<\/p><p>In the meantime, I will focus on the bachelor thesis and also try to post something once in a while. There are a lot of things I still have to get to know, and I\u2019m looking forward to it, plus there\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/soapatrick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/instagram.com\/soapatrick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram<\/a> to start using. So see you all on one of those platforms, or here\u2026<\/p>"},"id":"765efe58-310b-4847-8fa4-3fcc79185e30","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
