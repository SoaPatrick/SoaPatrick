Old: After months of looking and thinking about a design of my place, this is something I really like. It's simple, its clean, it's responsive (and I didn't do it myself). Well I did some tinkering (only slightly) and it's possible I will add some modifications in the future, but it's not my main issue. What I plan on doing now is using my just opened [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/SoaPatrick) account and also get this page fully ready. Meaning when you see that new name everywhere, you see where this might be headed.

In the meantime I will focus on the bachelor thesis and also try to post something once in a while. There are a lot of things I still have to get to know, and I'm looking forward to it, plus there's [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/soapatrick) and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/soapatrick) to start using. So see you all on one of those plattforms, or here...
