Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>After I finished school and got my bachelor's degree with an outstanding mark, I fell into a hole, which I was told was kinda normal. So Now I finally start to dig myself out of that hole again and start working on things again. This place got another facelifting because I realized that I need a way to showcase my work a bit better, so that\u2019s why there\u2019s a portfolio section that will grow even further in the future. But for now, it looks good with some important work I\u2019ve done in the past. I\u2019ve also put my bachelor work up there which I think is a fine work of user interface and interaction design.<\/p><p>I will try to write more things here (once again) even if it\u2019s just a small note or posting to a video I like\u2026<\/p>"},"id":"6c52a84e-ee87-41d8-830a-94988d95cc24","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
