Old: After I finished school and got my bachelor degree with an outstanding mark, I fell into a hole, which I was told was kinda normal. So Now I finally start to dig myself out of that whole again and start working on things again. This place got another facelifting because I realized that I need a way to showcase my work a bit better, so that's why there's a portfolio section which will grow even further in the future. But for now it looks good with some important work I've done in the past. I've also put my bachelor work up there which I think is a fine work of user interface and interaction design.

I will try to write more things here (once again) even if it's just a small note or posting a like to a video I like...
