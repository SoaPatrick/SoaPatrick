I mentioned in (link: http://soapatrick.com/2014/03/soap-logo-v4 text: yesterdays entry target: _blank), that after all the work I've put into a new logo design, I ended up not really feeling it and decided to start (once again) from scratch and I rather quickly I had this idea in my head of just having the two letter S and P forming a logo. The end result is something that looks extremely simple and stylish in my opinion. There is still some playing around which I plan on doing and then there is also the quest of finding a proper font for the written name but the general idea is something I quite like.
