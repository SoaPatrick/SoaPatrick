For work, I looked into the Bootstrap framework and realized how simple it is to create a responsive layout with it. So over Eastern, I had some time and started to create a simple layout with Bootstrap for SoaPatrick. Now, this weekend I moved that layout into a WordPress theme and this is what it looks like so far. Some things are still missing or not yet implemented (like the Portfolio or Archive) but I thought it\u2019s enough to make it public and work with it further on the live version.<\/p><p>What\u2019s also new is a slightly changed look of the logo on the left. I took the <a href=\"\/box\/and-another-try-at-a-soap-logo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">old one<\/a> and rotated it slightly to make it look more of a letter S instead of the letter P. And I created a new variation with lines instead of full-color spaces. I really like the new direction and the clean look and feel of it. As for the font, I searched long and hard and so far decided to go with Helvetica Neue to keep the clean look.<\/p><p>So I will keep working on the theme here on the live version<\/p>"},"id":"13d9176d-1653-44d4-826c-f9f9fea8d92e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
