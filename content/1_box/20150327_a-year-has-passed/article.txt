well almost a year has passed since I've done anything on this place and since just a logo has plastered the homepage. Well the reason for the change is because I had the urge to do something again and mostly I had the urge to use the little time I have on a daily basis to do something creative.

Among those creative things is taking pictures as you can see below. I recently bought myself a compact dls camera, the sony alpha 5000, and just went for a walk and took some pictures. One of those pictures is featured on top of this blog entry. Its Untouched and I think for one of my first it looks good and it's something I can build on.

So I try to just do things THINGS from now on and put it on here with no real pressure, just let it flow and see what comes out of it.
