Well, the reason for the change is because I had the urge to do something again and mostly I had the urge to use the little time I have on a daily basis to do something creative.<\/p><p>Among those creative things is taking pictures as you can see below. I recently bought myself a compact DLS camera, the Sony Alpha 5000, and just went for a walk and took some pictures. One of those pictures is featured on top of this blog entry. It's Untouched and I think for one of my first it looks good and it\u2019s something I can build on.<\/p><p>So I try to just do things THINGS from now on and put it on here with no real pressure, just let it flow and see what comes out of it.<\/p>"},"id":"116a4afa-35a9-43ce-8e54-c87171875f10","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
