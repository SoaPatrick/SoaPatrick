A beautiful shot, but extremely brutal movie about survivial and reveange. I enjoyed the movie but it lagged in the second act and I sometimes caught myself wishing it would end soon. What was missing for me as well was an emotional connection to the character Leo was playing. I wasn't that invested in his journey. But nonetheless the movie looks gorgeous especially when you consider it being lit with natural light and some scenes are so stunning that you wonder how the heck they did certain stuff. Very Good movie which could have been shorter with more of an emotional connection.
