While Watching it, especially the second act, I realized that I remembered it a bit better. The first part certainly has its funny moments and getting to know Derek and his sweet and naive and yet dumb character brings a lot to it but as we move on the movie starts to drag (as a 90 minutes movie that\u2019s kinda tough). But nonetheless, I look forward to the sequel and hope apart from the satirical look on the fashion industry and the stupidity of Zoolander and models in general the sequel has something new to offer.<\/p>"},"id":"5c26cba2-12d8-418a-b9b5-fe981665bbd9","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
