It still holds up well after the third viewing, to my surprise. The chemistry between the leads is still good and Zack Efron shows some good comedy chops. Of course, the humor is crude and simple but it works also because it never really feels too dumb. But the movie doesn\u2019t really move forward into new territories or push the genre to new grounds. What I noticed was the sometimes bad scene setup. There was a scene between Seth Rogan and Rose Byrne where they talk in front of a window with lighting coming from the outside and in the close-ups they are not properly lit because of the backlight\u2026 it just looked weird badly set up. In the end, it\u2019s a movie that guarantees a good time.<\/p>"},"id":"c0821be0-5593-483b-9570-683a5e3e5d6f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
