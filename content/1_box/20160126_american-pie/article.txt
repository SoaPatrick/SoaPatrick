I remember when it came out there was this huge hype about the movie, I think mostly it was because of the nudity, as this was pretty much before the internet had plenty of nude women to offer. Anyway just as back then I realized once again how poorly the movie is directed and how badly edited and mixed. Maybe it was a bad transfer but damn during the whole opening scene the music in the background is so silent you hardly notice it and it makes the movie look and feels weird. But during the movie, it becomes less and less noticeable. The cast is cute and there are some standouts and some who look pale in comparison. But the breakout performance for me has always been Alyson Hannigan as Michelle's one time in band camp\u2019. To conclude it all, the movie is poorly made and I can\u2019t quite understand how this movie became so popular to start a franchise since there are better teen movies on there. But still, it has its moments but those are quite spare and don\u2019t save the movie to get a good enough rating to really recommend it.<\/p>"},"id":"6fb77057-3486-428e-9e98-8edb7a3a3352","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
