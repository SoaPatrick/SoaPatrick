Since 1997 or so I've been collecting movie posters, preferably the original US double sided ones, and last year I painted the wall in one of my rooms at home in this very nice dark red (don't remember the exact name of the color right now) and put 4 frames on the that wall which can be opened from the front very easily. So now that I currently possess 62 posters I had to create something which lets me chose which posters to hang. the result is my (link: https://wall.soapatrick.com text: Poster Wall-Project target: _blank) where put the posters in the frames and then switch the order around through drag and drop.

So what you see is my current line up with the just recently bought _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_ and _John Whick Chapter 2_ posters :)
