But now that I finally saw it I can tell you that the first time I only watched Winona's reaction which is just too funny (she\u2019s still this dorky person even after all these years). But the second time I watched it, I actually listened to what was said and thanks to the very passionate delivery from David Harbour (aka Chief Hopper) I actually shed a tear a two. Damn what a speech, but see for yourself.<\/p>"},"id":"384a6cf9-f424-4a2b-8c9a-32e467bfef4e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
