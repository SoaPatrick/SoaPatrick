As A long time Winona Ryder fan and of course also a big time TV junkie who binge watched _Stranger Things_ within two days, I actually stumbled upon this speech from the SAG Awards by accident. But now that I finally saw it I can tell you that the first time I only watched Winonas reaction which is just too funny (she's still this dorky person even after all these years). But the second time I watched it, I actually listened to what was said and thanks to the very passionate delivery from David Harbour (aka Chief Hopper) I actually shed a tear a two. Damn what a speech, but see for yourself.
