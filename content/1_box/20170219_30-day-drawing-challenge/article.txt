Old: In order to get into gears when it comes to creativity and actually do something with my iPad Pro I decided to do the 30-day drawing challenge, starting tomorrow. The concept isn't new and googling '30 day drawing challenge' gets a lot of picture results from people doing the challenge (with sometimes different challenges). But I picked the basic one for my first go around and after 30 days I will find out how I did :)

So here's the list:

- Day 1: draw yourself
- Day 2: favorite animal
- Day 3: favorite food
- Day 4: favorite place
- Day 5: best friend
- Day 6: favorite book character
- Day 7: favorite word
- Day 8: favorite animated character
- Day 9: favorite tv show
- Day 10: favorite candy
- Day 11: turning point in your life
- Day 12: most recent accomplishment
- Day 13: comic
- Day 14: favorite fairytale
- Day 15: family portrait
- Day 16: inspiration
- Day 17: favorite plant
- Day 18: a doodle
- Day 19: something new
- Day 20: something orange
- Day 21: something you want
- Day 22: something you miss
- Day 23: something you need
- Day 24: something wild
- Day 25: scenery
- Day 26: something you don't like
- Day 27: someone you love
- Day 28: anything you'd like
- Day 29: a place you want to go
- Day 30: congratulations banner for finishing the challenge!

I will post the results daily on my (link: https://www.instagram.com/soapatrick/ text: Instagram account target: _blank)Â and maybe a short update here or combining a few days into one update, I don't know yet.

So in the words of Barney Stinson...
