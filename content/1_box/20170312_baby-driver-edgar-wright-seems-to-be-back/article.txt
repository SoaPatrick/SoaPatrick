Edgar Wright is probably one of the visually most interesting Directors working today. His Cornetto Trilogy puts a lot of US Comedies to shame (_Hot Fuzz_ being my favorite of the three) and so I'm quite interested in his new movie _Baby Driver._ The two just released trailers (US and Internation) hint at what's in store for the viewers and what I see is the Edgar Wright Trademark. Apart from the visual, the movie has a very strong cast and it's good to see Spacey bouncing back after his _Nine Lives_ fiasco.

So, Edgar, you had my curiosityâ€¦ but now you have my attention.
