While I was googling some things to keep the pigeons from shitting on my balcony, something very funny happened. Well, the easiest way seems to be to place a plastic raven on the balcony which scares the doves away. I then remembered that one of my neighbors has one of these already, so I looked out of the window to check it out and right at this very moment I saw a real life raven sitting on top of the plastic one. Seems the raves donâ€™t really care about them.

Turns out not only do Ravens not care about them, pigeons do neither. So instead of buying something which in the end has no effect I try the cheap version and hang a bunch of CDs up on a string. Apparently shiny stuff, meaning light bouncing off of them, scares birds away. So I keep you posted on how this turns out.
