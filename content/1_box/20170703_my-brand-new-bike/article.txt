I once owned a bike as a teenager and I actually had it for maybe a month before it was stolen. In the meantime, I used whatever bike my family didn\u2019t need at the moment and I think at the end I was the sole driver of my mom\u2019s bike until it was not functional anymore.<\/p><p>Recently I had the urge to go and make small bike tours in the summer so I looked around for a new bike, it didn\u2019t have to be expensive but for me, it had to look cool and fit several purposes. I stumbled upon a local bike shop that sells <em>Specialized <\/em>Bikes and there I found the <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.specialized.com\/ch\/de\/bikes\/fitness\/sirrus-disc-int\/115355\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sirrus Disc Int<\/a><\/em> which I really liked. A week later the freshly ordered bike was mine.<\/p><p>Then came the question of how to securely lock it and avoid my bike getting stolen again. After a week\u2019s worth of research, I found the best lock for me: <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kryptonitelock.com\/content\/kryt-us\/en\/products\/product-information\/current-key\/002079.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Kryptonite Evolution Mini-7 with Flex<\/a><\/em>.<\/p><p>So I\u2019m happy with how it all looks and I extremely enjoyed the small bike trips I took so far and the many more I will take in the future.<\/p>"},"id":"4d875e75-264c-43c8-9cce-3b6f3dbd67c2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
