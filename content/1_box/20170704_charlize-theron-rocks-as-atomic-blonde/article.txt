Keanu Reeves in _John Wick_ was such a surprise hit and good movie with great old school action scenes that it was just a matter of time before a sequel and more movies like it emerged. The Sequel came out last year and expended the world of _John Wick_. This year comes the female version of it. Well I don't know if the movie will be anything like John Wick but the Trailers for _Atomic Blonde_ sure play that card.

Nontheless it looks fucking awesome! Charlize Theron is an actress who I believe can really kick some ass and look good doing it at the same time. Just like John Wick there are interesting supporting Actors like John Goodman and John MacAvoy who seems to have a blast, Mix that with the setting of 80's Germany and 80's Germany Sound (Hopefully in the movie too) you've got a movie with a lot of potential. It all looks promising now I hope the finished movie delivers! \*Fingers Crossed\*
