The Sequel came out last year and expanded the world of <em>John Wick<\/em>. This year comes the female version of it. Well, I don\u2019t know if the movie will be anything like John Wick but the Trailers for <em>Atomic Blonde<\/em> sure play that card.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, it looks fucking awesome! Charlize Theron is an actress who I believe can really kick some ass and look good doing it at the same time. Just like John Wick there are interesting supporting Actors like John Goodman and John MacAvoy who seem to have a blast, Mix that with the setting of 80\u2019s Germany and 80\u2019s Germany Sound (Hopefully in the movie too) you\u2019ve got a movie with a lot of potentials. It all looks promising now I hope the finished movie delivers! *Fingers Crossed*<\/p>"},"id":"0c18d421-3ab4-44fb-ad27-d95362aa4a27","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
