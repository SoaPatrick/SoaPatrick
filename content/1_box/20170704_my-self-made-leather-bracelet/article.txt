I was never really the guy to wear bracelets and rings but I thought about giving it a try, just wanted to add something to my naked right arm (the apple watch is on the left wrist). Since Iâ€™m not the tattoo guy bracelets seem the obvious choice. But when I saw some of the prices for these leather bracelets I thought:

> well I can do this myself and save some money

So there I was with a mission and on a very hot afternoon (why did I have to choose a hot day for this) I checked some Do-It-Yourself stores and found some parts with which I could make my own bracelets.

- Leather band: 2.50 CHF
- Small trigger hook: 1.95 CHF

So I ended up paying a small fraction instead and I'm happy with it. Maybe my next one will be more sophisticated or maybe I add something more personal to it.
