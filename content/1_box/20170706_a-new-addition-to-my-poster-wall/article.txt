_Baby Driver_ is another month away from hitting theaters here in Switzerland but I'm already hyped for it. Besides being a new Edgar Wright Movie with a few kickass Trailers its reviews are also excellent.

So I had to buy the Teaser Poster for the movie once I saw it in my favorite Poster store (there is actually only one I know of to physically buy Posters). But that's not enough, I wanted the drawn (link: http://www.impawards.com/2017/baby_driver_ver2.html text: Main Poster target: _blank), so I tried something new: eBay. And voil√†, there was a guy/store which sells lots of Posters.

Of course, this isn't cheap but some Posters are worth it. And since paying $30 just for shipping I thought I buy another one: A (link: http://www.impawards.com/1999/fight_club_ver1.html text: _Fight Club_ Teaser Poster target: _blank). Yes I was having a small nerdgasm when I purchased these two posters and I can't wait to see them hanging on my beautiful Poster Wall (Picture will follow)
