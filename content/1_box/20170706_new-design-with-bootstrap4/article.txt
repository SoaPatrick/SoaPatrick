Old: I'm not much into spending too much time with the design of my website anymore, it keeps me from producing content which is more fun and is actually worth something. BUT I play around with the idea of redesigning the current theme with Bootstrap 4 once it's in Beta. I'm not promising anything right now, but the idea of having the whole structure done with a solid flexbox base through bootstrap 4 sounds intriguing. Well I guess we'll see how much time I'm willing to spend on it.
