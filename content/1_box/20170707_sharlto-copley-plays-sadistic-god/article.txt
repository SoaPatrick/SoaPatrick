Neill Blomkamp has created his own Film Production Company _[Oats Studios](https://www.oatsstudios.com/)_Â and has published various short experimental films through different channels ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD4ZEYIBnHIC2DUhiizMOHg) being one of them). So far they released four Short Films and while I didn't like most of them THAT much, they are still interesting to watch, and especially FREE!!

Now today they released their latest with Neill Blomkamp regular Sharlto Copley playing God in _God:Serengeti_. That was the first one I really liked because I assume sometimes it feels like this when the world acts kinda crazy and stuff happening out of nowhere.
