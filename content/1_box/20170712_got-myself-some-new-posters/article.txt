A few days ago I wrote a [blog entry](https://www.soapatrick.com/2017/07/a-new-addition-to-my-poster-wall/) about the Baby Driver Teaser Poster I bought and hung up my Poster Wall. I also mentioned that I found the Main Poster along with a rare Fight Club Teaser Poster on ebay which I immediately bought.

Today they arrived and they look stunning! So here's the current setup and it's gorgeous, I admit there's a lot of pink on the wall but damn who cares when you have such beautiful art covering your wall :) The price I payed for these two new additions was absolutely worth it!
