Realizing you suck at something is never easy, admitting defeat is just not in our DNA. So maybe this blog entry has some therapeutic effect. The last three times I went mini golfing I was defeated every single time and yesterday I was literally destroyed. I lost by fucking  21 points, that's more than 1 point per lane.

When comparing my score with the ones before (Graph below) I didn't improve nor did I get any worse. So maybe by me playing as bad as ever, I have to acknowledge my opponents performance. But when I analyze yesterdays performance, which was just VERY uneven, I see so much potential. I scored a hole-in-one on a lane you don't usually score hole-in-ones and then I there are lanes where I need like 6 attempts to finally sink the ball in the hole from a 30cm distance.

I'm a bit competitive, I admit that, but I can keep my cool  (unless it's on a tennis court). But that yesterday bugged me a bit. So what can I do? Go to courses each weekend and practice like crazy? Order a practice mini-golf set for my place? Or let something that does not matter truly _slide_ (see what I did there? Bonus points for those who noticed it). I guess the correct answer is obvious.
