Of course, no sequel, no matter how atrocious it might be, will tarnish the original movie in any way, but it still leaves a bad aftertaste.<\/p><p>Now my initial reaction was more or less apathetic towards a possible sequel, that changed once Denis Villeneuve was announced as the director. Now that\u2019s someone who knows how to combine intelligent, thought-provoking ideas with his very own visual style, plus the casting choices seemed to be on the clever side. So I was mildly interested in the first images, but the first trailer didn\u2019t exactly justify a spike in my excitement level. Too many bad sequels or reboots\/remakes from classics were produced in the last few years which tends to make people a bit more skeptical.<\/p><p>Now jump to two days ago when <em>Warner Bros.<\/em> released the third (and hopefully final) trailer which finally amped up the intensity and my excitement. Now I\u2019m not saying the movie will be good or bad, trailers are in no way an indicator of how good the finished movie will be. But I went from \u2018<em>ah who cares<\/em>\u2018 to \u2018<em>ok I might actually go to the cinema to check it out<\/em>\u2018 and that\u2019s no small feat, But judge for yourself.<\/p>"},"id":"871d5dbf-25ce-4f3c-bc0c-78c3a85df6fd","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
