I mean come on, they don\u2019t even put it out. After all, it\u2019s a burning piece of paper, on the ground, WHAT THE FUCK! Are people just too lazy to look for a trash can nearby or do they just not give a flying fuck?<\/p><p>(Just noticed the crude language, need to calm down a bit)<\/p><p>I see this at least once a day and if I had guts I\u2019d ask them why they just did that, but once you\u2019ve randomly and out of nowhere been beat up you tend to be a bit more careful when approaching strangers.<\/p><p>The sketch is something I\u2019ve drawn like 8 years ago (colorized now on the iPad) which means even back then it bugged the hell out of me. I had this idea of walking up to strangers who just threw something on the ground and asking them why they just did that when a clearly visible large trash container is nearby. Of course, I would have been accompanied by someone who could protect me. But I was just curious to learn why people do this. Maybe I will pick this idea up again, could be an interesting documentary short film.<\/p>"},"id":"99b97236-bbd7-496d-afba-447e7acb3b53","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
