Old: The past weekend was the biggest Con in the world, the San Diego Comic Con where Hollywood Studios hope to create a hype for their upcoming movies. So there's no surprise that some big Trailers for upcoming Movies or TV Shows have been dropped.

I'm not sure if there was ever someone winning Comic Con but if I were in that position to decide that, the Gold Medal would go to the trailer for the upcoming second season of _Stranger Things_. The first season caught everyone off guard and quickly became a smash hit. The expectations are high for the second season and the trailer is pushing those expectations overboard. So enjoy the trailer which for me is one of the best trailers ever for a TV Show.

A Special nod to the _Thor Ragnaro_k Trailer which is a close second. With stunning visuals and crazy action, this looks like a very funny buddy movie.

There was also an interesting trailer for Steven Spielberg's new movie [_Ready Player One_](https://youtu.be/dtwpjnuaVTE), hopefully, the CGI will be kept in check because the trailer is going overboard with it a few times. HBO released a short teaser for the second season of _[Westworld](https://youtu.be/phFM3V_dors)_ which is still almost a whole year off and Netflix has shown a longer trailer for the new _[Star Trek Discovery](https://youtu.be/oWnYtyNKPsA)_ series.

And then there's the almost 4min trailer for the _[Justice League](https://youtu.be/g_6yBZKj-eo)_ movie. I don't know, this looks clunky, forced and more of the same that didn't work in Batman v Superman. The jokes are not funny and the CGI looks bland, I guess Whedon didn't have any influence on dialogue yet.
