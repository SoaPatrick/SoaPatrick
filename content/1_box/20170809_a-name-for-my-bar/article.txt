Old: Now that the general look and feel of the Bar has been set, the question is on how to call that Bar. Every Bar needs to have a name after all people will associate the name with my place and the name will be dropped in conversations. Like:

> Let's go to \[enter bar name here\]

So picking the right name is essential to the success of it, so here's my list of names so far:

## Saiffistugg

This one is simply Soap Bar translated into Basel German. Would fit my ongoing theme of doing everything Soap-like

## Bar Solo

kind of a stupid one actually. Instead of Han Solo it would be Bar Solo, obviously.

## Bar-2-Dee-2

Same thing here, sticking to the Star Wars theme, this time with a variation of R2D2

## COSMO-Politain, Cosmo

These two are an attempt of going down a personal road with my Cat's name, but having the place called by a cat that passed away kinda seems wrong, I don't know.

## Zum lange Inseli, Zur lange Insle

These two are actually among my favorites and currently, the ones I consider choosing, not sure which one since I like both. It's my favorite Drink translated, again, into Basel German.

## Zum Saftlaade

a rather simple one, Basel Germans translation of _To The Bar_. In some way it's clever but it also is used to describe a shitty place, so I don't like the negativity attached to that word.

## Zum Basilisgg

Very simple with no real connection to a drinking place but to a mythical creature that is used on a lot of local images like on our fountains and flags.

So at this moment, the one I'd pick is either _Zum lange Inseli_/_Zur lange Insle_ or _Saiffistugg_. Or an even better name comes along, who knows. I still have some time until the bar actually opens but things are in motion and hopefully within two to three weeks the main part is done.
