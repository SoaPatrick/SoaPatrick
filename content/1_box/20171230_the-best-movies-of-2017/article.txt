I have to mention here that since my local cinemas don\u2019t show all the movies in English or sometimes just for a short period of time (some movies don\u2019t even make it at all) I haven\u2019t seen ALL the movies I wanted to see, plus time is another issue. Some Movies I\u2019ve yet to see are <em>Lady Bird<\/em> (from which I\u2019ve heard excellent things), <em>The Shape of Water<\/em> (DelToro seems to have delivered a masterpiece here), <em>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri<\/em> (Looks to be my kind of movie), <em>Mudboud <\/em>(Is on Netflix but didn\u2019t have the time yet) and <em>Mother<\/em> (I might squeeze that one in if I catch it in the last two days of this year). And once again, this is my list, it\u2019s not supposed to be a definitive list of what was good in 2017, just a list of movies I\u2019ve really enjoyed.<\/p><p>So here are my best-seen Movies of 2017, counting down from 10:<\/p>"},"id":"4401d6eb-0a2f-476a-89c2-8eaf141983c4","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"10. Spiderman Homecoming"},"id":"16d08bd9-5a1c-4024-b80c-a6d1c5fe9c3d","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>First I wasn\u2019t that enthusiastic for yet another new Spiderman Movie (even though his short appearance in Captain America Civil War was outstanding) since the last two movies were kinda shit. So I didn\u2019t see it in theatres but at home and I was really surprised by how good it is. The villain was excellent, the movie was fun, charming and the stakes were more personal and less \u2018World Ending\u2019 which was fitting to this high school Spiderman.<\/p>"},"id":"85ee1f3b-f867-4f93-80c2-828484ebc5d7","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"9. Thor Ragnarok"},"id":"bd38e70e-1dab-4863-a8e8-87f10629182d","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>What a change of style for a Thor Movie. Were the first two rather serious with some humor is the third a flat-out comedy and finally made Thor (and not Loki) the star of the Movie? Sure the Movie suffers from the usual Marvel Villain issue but everything else is just hilarious to watch. I\u2019ve had such an awesome time, just wish they\u2019ve kept Hulk's involvement a secret, that would have been such a nice surprise.<\/p>"},"id":"0aaa3269-e3ab-4b68-891a-71e962d58a5b","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"8. The Big Sick"},"id":"d4d90f98-29ed-4d1e-9268-865d8aa54a9e","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>What could be a by-the-book rom-com is actually one of the better romantic movies I\u2019ve ever seen because it offers a unique twist on the whole \u2018falling in love\u2019 concept. (shows that the best stories are still the ones that are based on real-life) Kumail Nanjiani breaks free from his<em> Silicon Valley<\/em> Role thanks to his own screenplay and Zoe Kazan just oozes charisma like no female actress.<\/p>"},"id":"785a75e5-d992-4125-9999-248b3ae6db6b","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"7. Get Out"},"id":"30f3092d-ae20-4a9c-9ec0-8d40b7d15d2f","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The first surprise hit of the year and a movie that benefits from you not having seen the trailer or heard anything at all from it. The Trailer kinda ruins a part of the movie but that doesn\u2019t diminish the movie. It\u2019s a clever twist on the horror genre and adds social commentary to it.<\/p>"},"id":"bc1d4fd6-05ca-40f6-a6b9-651f8861bb53","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"6. Star Wars: The Last Jedi"},"id":"c51a23be-66fe-4a52-9d20-fb597bf79bdc","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>This one was actually kind of a mixed bag after my first viewing. There are some things that bothered but then there are other things that blew me away and are some of the best Star Wars moments ever. After the second viewing the things that bothered me stayed but bothered me less and the awesome moments just became even better and I\u2019ve got goosebumps. No movie this year achieved that, therefore it deserves a place on this year's top ten list.<\/p>"},"id":"5fb78621-0fa4-492e-9784-23544a6cb5bf","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"5. Raw"},"id":"7f1c4d2c-9bc9-40df-8e2e-41ab4330f032","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Raw is probably the movie that stayed with me the longest and the most controversial movie on this year's list. But that movie caught me so off guard and I\u2019ve kept thinking about it for days. It was such a unique experience and I would just love to see it again with someone to discuss it further. If you get the chance I recommend watching it, just don\u2019t eat anything before, some things might be too strong for certain people.<\/p>"},"id":"d7c9bca5-2c22-4ca5-9009-fcfb4f869771","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"4. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"},"id":"100871dd-b32c-4d0a-99bb-9a1ecf6b5a9c","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>A movie where I refused to see any Trailers or TV Spots because I \nwanted to enjoy the movie on the big screen without knowing anything \nabout it. I had a blast from start to finish and I love all the \ncharacters and new additions. I laughed, I cried and I felt closer to \nall the characters at the end and I can\u2019t wait for their next adventure.\n I know the movie is far from perfect but not many movies made me feel \nthis way this year.<\/p>"},"id":"0ba3f994-4049-410c-af43-721c0f71be2e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"3. Baby Driver"},"id":"9895e749-74e9-43f4-887a-b3715e2bbc8e","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Probably my most recommended movie of the year, I told all my friends to go see this one. A two-hour movie that incorporated music like no other movie before. It\u2019s an amazing feat from director Edgar Wright. Some of the best car chase scenes I\u2019ve seen in a long time filled with a kick-ass soundtrack. Not sure about a planned sequel but with Edgar involved I\u2019m hopeful.<\/p>"},"id":"b093cafe-32fd-4d34-8a8b-addcbf421f1d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"2. Logan"},"id":"20f8a959-b84e-4898-a1b0-cedba00a618a","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The final performance from Hugh Jackman as Wolverine was also his best. One of the best Comic Book movies because it took the genre and made something new and interesting with it. It\u2019s more of a character piece and a western with very strong performances from Jackman and Steward which give their characters the best possible farewell they deserve.<\/p>"},"id":"8892b3a1-1f8d-4c17-8c85-9b4a802149d6","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"1. War of the Planet of the Apes"},"id":"b7f19b9b-dfbb-48a9-90f3-2a4c4b7bb311","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The two previous Apes movies were really good but for me, the final chapter in this Trilogy really went out with a bang. What a fine character study and an excellent performance by Andy Serkis (will Motion Capture one day be considered for awards?) and the best special effects I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s amazing that you start to feel for these apes because they act and feel real. The best adult movie trilogy out there, who would have thought that when they announced remakes of the classic <em>Planet of the Apes<\/em> Movies.<\/p>"},"id":"3212965b-d413-4dcb-a052-24c257315116","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
