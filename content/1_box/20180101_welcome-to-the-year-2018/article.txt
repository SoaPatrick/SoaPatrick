As for me I had a fun night even went out to see the firework, something I haven\u2019t done in the last few years.<\/p><p>So, with my first post in 2018, I wanted to explain what I plan on doing with this place in this new year, or rather what one of my new year\u2019s resolutions is. I know that I will sound like a broken record but my goal is to actually publish something daily here this year. It doesn\u2019t have to be something big, it can be just a quote, a link or a short status update but I have to do it daily, that\u2019s the requirement.<\/p><p>The idea is to create a habit of posting daily where it\u2019s just part of my daily routine. What I hope to achieve through that is to find my own voice again and maybe even transfer that to other creative fields, like drawing, photography or even videography.<\/p><p>So I\u2019m excited and I hope I can deliver and maybe you will join me on this journey, so see you tomorrow!<\/p>"},"id":"8c28facb-10d4-4684-8219-e6e831a75b51","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
