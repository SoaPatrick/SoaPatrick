Now recently two things changed. After 3 years I bought myself a new phone and there was a good offer on the Airpods, so I made the purchase. (Plus you see them everywhere so I guess they\u2019ve become mainstream and\/or accepted)<\/p><p>So my initial thoughts are <em>WOW<\/em>. The pairing process is super easy and thanks to the charging Case you always have some battery pack with you, plus with these, I always know how much battery is left for either Airpod or the Case. Since I have weird and super-tight ear canals, I can\u2019t really wear In-Ear Headphones, so I\u2019m stuck with Ear-Pods and I think these are the best Wireless ones out there (also because like 99% of all Wireless Earphones are In-Ear). Soundwise they are fine, same as the corded ones, and that\u2019s just fine by me. For quiet and awesome Sound on-the-go I still have my Over ear BeoPlay h6 (though they might get replaced soon too, depends on pricing and feature of future Bluetooth BeoPlay Headphones).<\/p><p>So I will probably write again in like two months or so and give you some feedback if I\u2019m still happy with them.<\/p>"},"id":"9d237956-7fa9-4f85-970e-5cd113d0d8ae","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
