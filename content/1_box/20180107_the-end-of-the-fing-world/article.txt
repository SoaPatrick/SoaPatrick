I stumbled upon this new TV Show on Netflix and four Episodes in I'm hooked. Love the very dry and British style, nothing flashy. But on the other hand, it's a very raw show and it definitely isn't afraid of going for it. The two leads are very interesting and you kinda want to follow their path (of self-destruction and self-discovery?).

I love shows like these, short and to the point, no messing around. I mean 8 episodes of 20 minutes each, and thanks to Netflix you can watch the whole thing on an evening when you're bored (which I won't, can't be able to see them all tonight, tomorrow is Monday, ugh! Work again)
