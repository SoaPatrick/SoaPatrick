Old:

> I feel like there's a lot of goodness in me, a lot of greatness, but I can't get it out of me. I can't give it to the world. I have ideas. I'm not an echo. I make things in my mind, but I can't get them into the world. I can't get past this. It's like a trap. Like the world won't see the… me… the real me.
