I just finished watching _Geostorm_ and I had such a blast even though the movie is such garbage. It would have made my (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2017/12/the-worst-movies-of-2017/ text: Top 10 Worst Movies of 2017 target: _blank) easily, but compared to another recent stinker (Looking at you _The Snowman_, you are an absolute bore and I hardly could keep my eyes open) I actually laughed out loud several times because at the sheer stupidity of it. The saying "It's so bad it's good" is definitely appropriate for this movie.

This is one of those movies which is good for a drunk evening with friends and just have fun laughing at movies. Not even the _Transformer_ Movies are that much fun. If you get the chance to watch it, do it, but please don't spend any money on it, it's just not worth it.

Here's the trailer to wet your appetite a bit.
