Statustext: <p>I made some housecleaning on my blog (removed old Themes and Plugins I don't use anymore) and also some old Blogs that used up Databases. And at the same time though I could finally use <strong>Git</strong> to develop and deploy changes to the theme. It's a much more streamlined development workflow now which hopefully brings lots of benefits, especially for a possible future new design.</p>
