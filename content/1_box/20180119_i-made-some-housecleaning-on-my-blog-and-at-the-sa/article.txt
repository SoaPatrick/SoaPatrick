Old: I made some housecleaning on my blog (removed old Themes and Plugins I don't use anymore) and also some old Blogs who used up Databases. And at the same time thought I could finally use **Git** to develop and deploy changes to the theme. It's a much more streamlined development workflow now which hopefully brings lots of benefits, especially for a possible future new design.
