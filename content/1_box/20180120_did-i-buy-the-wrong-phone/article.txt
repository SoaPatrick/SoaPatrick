I've been an iPhone user since day one, my mom bought me a 1st Generation iPhone from the states. I've had an iPhone 1, iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, iPhone 5 and I've used the iPhone 6 for three years when Apple released the iPhone X. I knew it was time for a new Phone but I was somehow skeptical of the iPhone X because of the notch and Face ID. On December 23rd I was in a spontaneous mood so I went and bought myself a new iPhone X. But before that, I actually played around with the idea of leaving the Apple Ecosystem and try out an Android Phone, because there are just way more Brands to choose from. With Apple, you get a new Phone presented each year and they all look similar with a few new spare features. But with Android you get dozens of different models, sizes, colors and the price range is huge.

Among the Phones I considered were the [One Plus 5T](https://oneplus.net/de/5t) and the [Google Pixel 2 XL](https://store.google.com/de/product/pixel_2). I was really close to chose either one of these but then I checked which are my top two Apps I used on my Phone and if there is an Android version or at least something similar and no there was. That had a huge influence on my decision so I decided to stick to iOS for another 2-3 Years but these might be the last years with an iPhone because I think I have to distance myself a bit to keep my options open for my next Phone. But then again, a lot can happen in 2-3 years with the whole Phone-Industry.

But then One Plus comes out with a new red Version of their Flagship Phone, the One Plus 5T Red Lava, damn that looks gorgeous, I'm a sucker for red. For a second I thought about buying one and have a transition phase of using two Phones, which I agree is ridiculous, that's why I said I only thought about it for a **second**. But then I was reminded that I use a very slick [Metallic Red Case](https://www.spigen.com/products/iphone-x-case-thin-fit?variant=37407089025) for my iPhone X so all was well again. But it was a close one this time, might not be in another two years.
