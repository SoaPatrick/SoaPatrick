So the [Nominations](http://oscar.go.com/nominees) are out and some surprises, some not so surprises and the obvious choices after all the previous awards winners. As for me, I'm glad that Gary Oldman seems to be the front-runner for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It's time he gets some well-deserved recognition. Also nice to see that _Logan_ got some recognition with a Nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. And by god, I surely hope that _War of the Planet of the Apes_ wins that Oscar for best Special Effekt because these were fucking amazing. Anyway, I will watch the show, like all the previous 20 years, and I will bitch and moan about winners and losers, but it's part of the fun.
