I haven't posted a trailer for a long time but then again there weren't many that really hit me (maybe except for the [_Avengers_ one](https://youtu.be/6ZfuNTqbHE8), or Trailer forÂ  [_The Thoroughbreds_](https://youtu.be/TPcV_3D3V2A). This one however kinda hit me emotionally and it came out of nowhere, plus bonus points for Andrew Clark a.k.a Mr. Mighty Ducks a.k.a. Emilio Estevez returning to the screen and even writing and directing this one. He has put together a strong and interesting cast so I'm curious what he has done with it all.
