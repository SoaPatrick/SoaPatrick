First, it was because I \nwasn\u2019t in the mood of trimming it every other week during my vacation \nand I thought why not grow it a bit. And second, the beard \nreceived great feedback so I kept it and I kept growing it. Just \nsometimes I had to trim it slightly and then right before Christmas it \nstarted to become long and even annoying sometimes and because I didn\u2019t \nhave a trimming machine at home which could cut longer than 10mm I \ndecided to look for a barber. Unfortunately, my timing wasn\u2019t the best, \neveryone wanted to look their best for Christmas so getting an \nappointment wasn\u2019t possible. I decided to trim it back myself to 10mm \nmax but I wasn\u2019t too happy with how short it suddenly looked so I \nstarted growing it again.<\/p> <p>Now more than a month later it\u2019s getting long again and I\u2019m faced \nwith the same decision once more. Cut back to 10mm, make an appointment \nat a barber OR, and that\u2019s another possibility, use the hair trimmer \nwith longer trimming attachment. I think for me my ideal beard length is\n around 20mm, I think. So I want to be able to cut back to that length \nat the front and keep the side a bit short, the question is trim it \nmyself?<\/p> <p>But whatever I decide, a beard this long is temporary, the moment it \ngets warmer I will cut it back to the 3mm I used to wear for the past 5 \nyears now. It\u2019s just more comfortable with all the humidity and \nextremely high temperatures during the summer. In colder months a nice \nlong beard keeps the face warm though, which is nice.<\/p>"},"id":"21458335-7437-41ad-b89c-4c1ffc8fd5cb","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
