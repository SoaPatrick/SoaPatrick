This was achieved with 10 lines of SASS, not everything was styled\n and a final version might change the header image as well, this one was\n just inverted.

Like I mentioned yesterday, the idea is to have a theme with a pure black background because on OLED displays, a Pixel displaying the color black is just a Pixel not lit up, so the device saves energy by not lighting up the background of the page is black. I think there was an article once about how much energy could be saved if Google makes their starting website black instead of white. (Found it: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/How-much-energy-would-be-saved-if-Google-used-a-black-screen-instead-of-white\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How much energy would be saved if Google used a black screen instead of white?<\/a>)<\/p><p>Now I\u2018m not saying I could solve the energy crisis by making my page black, but I\u2018d love the idea of having a dark theme for stylistic reasons as well and if I save a bit of battery for my visitors then all the better. But the idea is to make a completely new design, and not just turn this one black. It\u2018s too early to discuss any more details though as it\u2018s still in a \u201cthinking about\u201d stage.<\/p>"},"id":"68be260c-1f02-426f-9cd4-e2103f01e3fc","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
