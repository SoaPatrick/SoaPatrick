There are some blog posts, especially from way back in the day, where I talk about shooting movies. There are even two Short Films, Short Films? Let's not call them Short Films, let's just call them Scenes or Clips. One was (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2013/06/the-insider-goes-vimeo/ text: The Insider target: _blank) and the other one was (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2013/06/slippery-follows-insider/ text: Slippery When Wet target: _blank). It was fun shooting them and learning some stuff but like I mentioned, that was way back in the day shot with a Video 8 camera in SD. Nowadays with an iPhone X, I can shoot in friggin' 4K Resolution! I always imagine buying a DSLR, like the **Canon EOS 80D**, or a Drone, like the new **DJI Mavic Air** for really cool footage, but at the end of the day, even with all the fancy and expensive equipment, it all comes down to actually doing it and that I can do with my smartphone and save some money. The only thing that's missing is an idea for a quick funny/clever/interesting video.

Now I will think about this a bit, make notes, write down ideas and just start shooting stuff, even bad stuff but, just like with writing a Blog Post every day, **JUST DO IT!**
