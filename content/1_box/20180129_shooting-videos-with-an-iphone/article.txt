There are even two Short Films, Short \nFilms? Let\u2019s not call them Short Films, let\u2019s just call them Scenes or \nClips. One was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.soapatrick.com\/2013\/06\/the-insider-goes-vimeo\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Insider<\/a> and the other one was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.soapatrick.com\/2013\/06\/slippery-follows-insider\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slippery When Wet<\/a>.\n It was fun shooting them and learning some stuff but like I mentioned, \nthat was way back in the day shot with a Video 8 camera in SD. \nNowadays with an iPhone X, I can shoot in friggin\u2019 4K Resolution! I \nalways imagine buying a DSLR, like the <strong>Canon EOS 80D<\/strong>, or a Drone, like the new <strong>DJI Mavic Air<\/strong> for\n really cool footage, but at the end of the day, even with all the fancy\n and expensive equipment, it all comes down to actually doing it and \nthat I can do with my smartphone and save some money. The only thing \nthat\u2019s missing is an idea for a quick funny\/clever\/interesting video.<\/p> <p>Now I will think about this a bit, make notes, write down ideas and \njust start shooting stuff, even bad stuff but, just like with writing a \nBlog Post every day, <strong>JUST DO IT!<\/strong><\/p>"},"id":"cdfee35c-cc37-467c-887e-aae77b629e1e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
