Funny coincidence, yesterday I talked about shooting videos on an iPhone X because of its ability to shoot in 4K Resolution and later that evening, FOX releases the Trailer for Steven Soderbergh‘s new movie. Soderbergh has always been auteur by trying new things, so this time he shot an entire Movie with an iPhone X and according to the [Interview in IndieWire](http://www.indiewire.com/2018/01/steven-soderbergh-interview-sundance-iphone-unsane-1201921769/) he‘s thinking about only shooting on iPhones in the future. There are two interesting quotes from him from this article:

> Anybody going to see this movie who has no idea of the backstory to the production will have no idea this was shot on the phone. That’s not part of the conceit.

> People forget, this is a 4k capture. I’ve seen it 40 feet tall. It looks like velvet. This is a gamechanger to me.

Of course, the Technical side is one thing but when seeing the trailer, the movie intrigued me and didn‘t realize it was shot on an iPhone, sure it didn‘t look like a high gloss movie, but an iPhone? Nevertheless, I‘m really curious about this movie and can‘t wait to see it.
