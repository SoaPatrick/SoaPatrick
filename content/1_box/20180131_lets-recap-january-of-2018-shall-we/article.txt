First, after gaining a bit of weight over the holidays and \nbecause I haven\u2018t worked out since last October, I wanted to get back on\n the bike at home and really start using it again, not long but at least\n do it daily. That went quite nicely. Apart from January 2nd I had a \ntraining session each day, 29 times on the bike (usually at least for 30\n minutes right after work) and I also went for a walk four times \n(usually longer than 60 minutes and on weekends). It felt good and I \nneed the exercise to get in shape for spring when I plan on doing longer\n bike trips.<\/p> <p>Another New Year\u2019s Resolution was to write a daily Blog Post. And \neven though it was sometimes hard to come up with something to write \nabout, I actually have 31 blog entries in January. Of course, there were\n times where I just posted a quote because I was short on time but it\u2018s a\n Blog Post nonetheless.<\/p> <p>So working out and writing a Blog Post on a daily basis kept me busy,\n especially during the weekdays and here\u2018s the deal now: It\u2018s hard and I\n sometimes could use a breather, from either one of the two activities. \nOn one hand, I think it\u2018s no big deal to reduce blogging to two Blog \nPosts per week, these could be fleshed out a bit and be better written \n(you know: write, read, rewrite, read again and add final touches \ninstead of just writing and then publishing). But I feel like I would \nchicken out from the whole deal to blog daily.<\/p> <p>The working out part is something I think I can leave out once in a while without cheating, the body needs some rest after all.<\/p> <p>So I\u2018m kinda in a predicament and I don\u2018t know how to proceed, I mean\n I\u2018d love to maybe work on the black WordPress theme, shoot a nice video\n or write a screenplay once in a while and I think the daily blog posts \nmight get in the way of that and I don\u2018t want to fill the blog up with \nquotes, links or short status updates.<\/p> <p>So I guess I need to think about it and see what the ideal plan is without losing the drive I currently have.<\/p>"},"id":"3ab8096c-af2b-4ade-8e90-d7868794ea69","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
