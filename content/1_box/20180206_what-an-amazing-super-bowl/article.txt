I’ve been watching the Super Bowl for the last 20 years or so, it‘s one of my traditions, so I’ve seen my fair share of games and there have been some turds over the years. But what I’ve seen on Sunday Night was spectacular. It was pure offense spectacle and I‘ve never seen so much passing yards, I think it set a new record after 3 quarters already. I thoroughly enjoyed the game throughout its entirety, of course it helps that Brady got his ass kicked.

## Justin’s Halftime Show

The halftime show wasn‘t bad, Justin Timberlake played his greatest hits and there even was a nice homage to Price, or the Artist formerly known as Prince. But The mixing wasn‘t the best as I had problems hearing his voice and differentiating it from the background playback, but he entertained me while eating tasty burgers!

## Big Game Trailers

Thanks to the NFL Game Pass I was able to see all the commercials and there were a few which really stood out, but I‘m more interested in the latest Big Game Trailers for all the upcoming Movie Blockbusters. There are four highlights.

First the there was there first ever publicity for the _(link: https://youtu.be/dNW0B0HsvVs text: Solo: A Star Wars Story target: _blank)_. The Teaser was quite good, some nice images, but I don‘t know about Alden Ehrenreichs’ performance as Han Solo, I‘m ok with him not doing an impression but I‘m not sold yet, though I‘m not of the people who have a problem with his casting. His performance in _Hail Ceaser!_ was actually the highlight of that movie.

Then there was a short Spot for (link: https://youtu.be/pVxOVlm_lE8 text: _Avengers Infinity Wars_ target: _blank), some cool shots there and a menacing clip of Thanos, I really don‘t have to see anything further to look forward to this movie, I‘m already sold with what I‘ve seen so far.

We've also got a very stylish teaser for the second season of (link: https://youtu.be/qUmfriZoMw0 text: _Westworld_ target: _blank) which is suddenly so near, it's a good pastime until April 2019 when the last season of _Game of Thrones_ finally arrives.

But for me, the biggest highlight was a kick-ass trailer for _(link: https://youtu.be/wb49-oV0F78 text: Mission Impossible Fallout target: _blank)_. The 6th entry in the Mission Impossible Franchise sure looks like they haven‘t kept back, Tom Cruise sure didn‘t, even his foot breaking scene is in the trailer. Love or Hate the guy, he sure is a pro when it comes to doing his job.

## Funny Commercials

Then there were the usual commercials for services and products and there for me is one clear winner: (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGXnE1Dbh0 text: It‘s a Tide ad target: _blank). Having David Harbour from _Stranger Things_ in it is a plus but damn that was clever and fun marketing.
