The _Deadpool_ Marketing Machine keeps getting funnier and funnier and is still very meta (they have to be careful about becoming too meta though). It all started with the first (link: https://youtu.be/I4tFNfROlqk text: Teaser target: _blank) shown before _Logan_ back in March of 2017 and then it picked up 8 months later again with a funny (link: https://youtu.be/2-5Wv9UGkN8 text: Bob Ross spoof target: _blank) in November and now we finally have _Deadpool_ introduce the main antagonist Cable in this funny (link: https://youtu.be/vKEqQrk98kI text: Teaser target: _blank).

I like where all this is going and Iâ€™m sure we will get many many more cool clips and posters and whatnot from _Deadpool_ until the movie opens. The Marketing Campaign for the first one was already clever so I expect nothing less from the sequel.
