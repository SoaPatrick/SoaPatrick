Old: Just a quick shout out to Apple for fixing my Display free of charge after I accidentally dropped it, well it flew out of my jacket's pocket. After that, there was a black spot on the top left corner (apparently liquid which could have spread further over time) and it blocked the time. I'm a happy guy again with a fully functional iPhone!
