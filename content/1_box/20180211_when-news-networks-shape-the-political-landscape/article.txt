I love the guys at _[Vox](https://www.youtube.com/user/voxdotcom)_ and the work that they do. One of their latest video essay paints a very dangerous image on how a right-wing media empire (that's known for being anything but fair and balanced, just watch the documentaryÂ [Outfoxed](https://vimeo.com/227704090)) can shape the political landscape by 'talking to' the President of the United States directly and therefor influence him. It's amazing what they found out and how they present their findings and it's fucking scary!
