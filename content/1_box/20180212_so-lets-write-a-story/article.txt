Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>So I\u2018m sitting on the train, ready to start a story. Well kinda \nready, it helps to have like a starting point from which the story \nevolves, and that\u2018s what\u2018s currently missing, plus I don\u2018t want people \nglancing at my iPad and reading all the weird stuff I\u2018m about to write, \nso I wait a bit until I\u2018m sure I don\u2018t have anyone sitting next to me.<\/p> <p>\u2026<em>waits<\/em>\u2026<\/p> <p>I just realized that it\u2018s not that easy, it used to be easy but I \nguess that was because I was writing in German. There are still words \nthat I have to think about for a second and this can cause the flow to \nget interrupted. A possibility would be to write a short fast story in \nGerman and then rewrite and edit the story in English, you know polish \nit at the same time.<\/p> <p>Another thing I realized is the keyboard, having a good keyboard on \nwhich I can quickly type is important and while the Logitech keyboard \nfor my iPad is quite ok it\u2018s not a full-fledged keyboard from a Laptop \nor a desktop. So I could either skip the idea and write at home or take a\n laptop with me for commuting. Both don\u2018t sound appealing.<\/p>"},"id":"fcd6d576-e237-4c0d-a759-956fa67d247d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":[],"id":"60021cda-6c95-4f88-89ed-553a6faf4d39","isHidden":false,"type":"line"},{"content":{"text":"<p><em>Henry opens the letter very carefully, his guilt has vanished, \nthe curiosity has taken over and pure jealousy is now the driving force \nfor his actions. He unfolds the piece of paper and reads the content of \nthe letter, his eyes glued to every word, analyzing each sentence, \nlooking for clues, for hints for anything really to confirm his feeling.\n Arriving at the end he\u2018s confused, he turns the letter but there is \nnothing left. He searches the envelope but nothing. He goes through the \nletter again, in hope of having missed anything but all it does is \nmaking him angrier. He was so sure he\u2018d find something. He rips the \nletter into tiny little pieces but it doesn\u2018t help, it doesn\u2018t diminish \nthe rage inside of him.<\/em><\/p>"},"id":"a434d31c-a54d-441c-9b37-a9e6d705daaa","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":[],"id":"ab0a8d4b-b403-4ea0-8362-45344a63d77f","isHidden":false,"type":"line"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Yap, it\u2018s definitely easier in German and on a regular-sized keyboard. My writing performance lacks the speed of my mind and reacting to quick decisions on where to go with the story. When I\u2018m writing and my mind has to stop for a moment in order for my fingers to keep up it does tend to question what I\u2018m about to write and the idea of this whole process was to avoid thinking too much about what I write and just write. Editing would come later when there\u2018s a foundation to work with.<\/p><p>Oh well, this kinda blows a bit. I have to think about it where to go from here, I don\u2018t wanna carry around my MacBook Air with me, even though it\u2018s light, but it\u2018s not light enough.<\/p>"},"id":"b434971a-3981-4661-9acb-5bf493881a30","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
