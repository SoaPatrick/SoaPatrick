So I’m having my own bar at home for 5 months and I’m loving it. I’m discovering new drinks and new tastes every weekend and I love the atmosphere of it when friends are coming over and sit down on one of the bar stools, ordering a drink, me mixing them a drink and then us having a nice conversation. There’s just something elegant about it. It used to be me sitting at a dining table mixing drinks while my guests are sitting on the coach. This concept now is how it’s supposed to be.

There’s a downside to it though. I drink a bit more, I mean someone has to test all these new drinks, and some of them are mighty tasty! But I really try to reduce it all to just weekends, can’t afford to get tipsy just a little bit on a working day. Here are some new drinks I’ve discovered are:

- Amaretto Sour
- Castro Cooler
- Del Mar
- Godfather
- Honey Ginger
- Leichtmatrose
- Moscow Mule
- White Russian

And the [book](https://www.amazon.de/Schumanns-Bar-Charles-Schumann/dp/3898835022) I’ve bought (my Bar Bible so to speak) is full of drinks I still have to try out. I’m looking forward it though, my liver and kidney not so much I assume.
