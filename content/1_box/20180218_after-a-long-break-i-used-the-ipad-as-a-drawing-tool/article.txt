Statustext: <p>After a long break, I used the iPad as a drawing tool, which was a lot of fun using the pencil again. I kinda missed it actually, but of course, it helps to have a day off to use it because drawing takes so much time. But who knows, I might use it again more often in the near future and some cool stuff. The work I did today will be shown a bit later, it's something I've drawn for a special occasion.</p>
