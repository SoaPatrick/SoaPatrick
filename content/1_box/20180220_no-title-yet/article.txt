Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Made some thinking the last two days and I think I realized a few things, so instead of keeping those realizations looked in my head spinning around, I thought <em>hey this is what my blog is for, right?<\/em> So here it is: I focus too much on the little things, on the small details instead of seeing the bigger picture. That\u2019s one thing, the other thing is that I cannot get better at something if I don\u2019t actually practice it. But let me give some examples to better illustrate what I mean.<\/p>"},"id":"d3bdedc8-5a03-4b5d-86a9-77b311359c22","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"The Bigger Picture"},"id":"0b117b9d-d175-47d6-a4e5-9b8b9cd6c597","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Recently I had the urge to start shooting small videos again, you know actually use my 4K iPhone Camera and try some stuff out. But during that thought process, I realized that I focus too much on a single scene, trying to make the perfect shot instead of thinking that each of these shots\/scenes will be part of a longer video which is more important than just one individual scene. Sure the clips have to look good but when I spend too much time on each individual shot there\u2019s no time left for the next one and time is precious these days.<\/p>"},"id":"41f52314-fcb3-47a2-9ffc-b930f287c3d0","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Practice, practice, practice"},"id":"b1257aa6-e74b-48eb-9565-c650b59e5758","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I created a new time-lapse video of me drawing something on the iPad \nand I wanted to edit that. So first I opened iMovie, but I had problems \nthere. Then I tried Adobe Premiere, again, problems with the software. \nFinally, I tried Adobe After Effects and you guessed it, once again I \nhad problems handling the software. The issues I had are not software \nspecific but rather a lack of practice using them. So how can I improve \nmyself if I hardly use any of them and don\u2019t know how to use them \nproperly. I know how to handle Photoshop and a bit of Illustrator but \nthat didn\u2019t happen overnight. I had to practice a lot to get where I am \ntoday.<\/p> <p>So how can I make videos when I lack the skills to actually edit \ndifferent scenes together quickly? Of course, I get frustrated when I \nsee how long it takes to make them into a coherent video. I guess I have\n to start actually doing it and get better and more importantly faster \nthrough practice so that I can focus on shooting videos and the creative\n process of editing them instead of how to use the software.<\/p>"},"id":"0b23a9c0-cbac-4e13-ab11-36158f5abb52","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"One more thing\u2026"},"id":"88574bb8-74da-462e-8b64-5294d7def663","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Another Bonus thing I realized: I tend to take pictures and videos on\n my Phone but hardly do stuff with them, why not use these for \nsomething? I mean, why take pictures and videos in the first place then?\n So my goal has to be to actually use some of the stuff I take and \ncreate something with them. I also have an idea how to enforce these new\n realizations but that\u2019s a topic for another day.<\/p>"},"id":"bd9308d1-1306-46c6-9e73-31479b34df26","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
