A few years ago I started to play around with drawing on the iPad (back then without the precision of the Apple Pencil) and character Animation. It was a good learning experience but, like I mentioned on (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/02/no-title-yet/ text: Tuesday target: _blank), the actual process of animating the character was much much longer because of my inexperience using After Effects. It's one of those things that with more time using it, my animations would become better and more sophisticated and at the same time, I would need less time to actually animate it.

But nonetheless, it's a fun little video. Back then I had the idea to start some sort of series with _Unser Chef_ but it's one of those things, among many things, which I started and then because it takes too much time giving up on. Maybe I will pick that idea up again, maybe in a different form. But more on that later.
