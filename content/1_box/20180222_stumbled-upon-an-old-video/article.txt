It was a good learning experience but, as I mentioned on Tuesday, the actual process of animating the character was much much longer because of my inexperience using After Effects. It\u2019s one of those things that with more time using it, my animations would become better and more sophisticated and at the same time, I would need less time to actually animate it.<\/p><p>But nonetheless, it\u2019s a fun little video. Back then I had the idea to start some sort of series with <em>Unser Chef<\/em> but it\u2019s one of those things, among many things, which I started and then because it takes too much time giving upon. Maybe I will pick that idea up again, maybe in a different form. But more on that later.<\/p>"},"id":"27d27252-6245-4386-b41a-c2d96bf45c9d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
