Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I started shooting more photos with my iPhone again (after all the camera is a lot better on the iPhone X than on my old iPhone 6) and so far I've posted a lot of them on Instagram but some of these images I've felt like could be posted on the blog instead. But then how do I do that? I haven't considered posting Blog Posts consisting ONLY of a photo. I have to think about that, maybe do some coding and change the theme a bit. Uff more work.<\/p>"},"id":"acc38922-4b5e-4d27-ae91-daa155969832","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
