For my mothers birthday, I thought I could expand the drawing I once made for the _[30 Day Drawing Challenge](https://www.soapatrick.com/2017/03/third-week-of-the-drawing-challenge/)_. It meant improving it further, draw it on a canvas with a much bigger resolution and in the end colorize it as well. I had fun going back to that drawing and find new things I can improve upon and also learn drawing cartoon shadows. I‘ve chosen a big canvas (4096x4096 pixel) so that printing the drawing has no effect on its quality. In the end, I made small changes again in Photoshop (just like with my cute little [T-Rex](https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/02/my-first-own-drawn-cartoon-character/)) like positioning some elements and some tiny color corrections.

My mother was delighted with the final result and I‘m curious how the drawing will look like when it‘s printed out on a 40x40 or 60x60 centimeter.
