When I read this post a few years from now I get a sense of what I did the past month.<\/p><p>I\u2018m still on track to post daily, 28 Blog Posts this month, and what I\u2018ve also tried to avoid recently, I mentioned that in a previous <a href=\"\/box\/why-use-generic-stock-images\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blog Post<\/a>, is using stock images. Use either a drawing or a photo I\u2018ve made or leave the featured image out completely and add a suitable Font Awesome Icon instead.<\/p><p>And I think I\u2018ve found my groove with writing something on a daily basis. There were days when I didn\u2018t have a subject so I quickly wrote something about what happened to me instead or when I was out of time I simply added a fitting quote. Plus I started to think less about how my posts are received and more about what I feel like writing, the <a href=\"\/box\/morgestraich-vorwarts-marsch\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">swiss german post<\/a> is definitely something that stood out and I love it. Though it\u2018s easy with that small amount of readers.<\/p><p>On the fitness topic, I didn\u2018t keep up with a daily training session, unfortunately. There was definitely something that had to be reduced, it was just too much. Then there was <strong>Fasnacht<\/strong> for three days so something\u2018s gotta give. But I\u2018m still optimistic to be in shape for some nice bike tours once it gets warmer, which is hopefully very soon.<\/p><p>Then there are the new weekly tasks which I\u2018m curious how it will play out. I mentioned the predicament in <a href=\"\/box\/lets-recap-january-of-2018-shall-we\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">last month's recap<\/a> and I think I found a nice compromise. I love the idea and I\u2018m, so far, determined to keep that up, I have some ideas and I want to see them realized.<\/p><p>So let\u2019s see how this journey continues this very productive year so far.<\/p>"},"id":"9c7928c9-f72c-4d46-84f6-f7355dc85bfb","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
