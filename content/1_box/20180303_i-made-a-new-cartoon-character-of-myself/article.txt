I once again started to draw on the iPad \nwith <a href=\"https:\/\/procreate.art\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Procreate<\/a>,\n then once I had a very good base (colors included) I thought I could go\n one step further this time and redraw it in Illustrator to give it this\n smooth look and have a vector image for lots of possibilities. I had \nsome problems first but the longer I worked on it, the faster and better\n I got (oh what a surprise). For easy redrawing, I used <a href=\"https:\/\/astropad.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Astropad<\/a>\n which allowed me to use the iPad as an input device for the mac and \nthen could draw the shapes with the Apple Pencil. Then I googled a bit \non how to animate that now in After Effects and then I discovered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/products\/character-animator.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe Character Animator<\/a>\n and I felt like I discovered something magical. So I played around with\n it a bit and there\u2019s a small learning curve but once you have your \ncharacter puppet you can do so much cool stuff.<\/p> <p>So I\u2019m not ready to show some animation but the goal is clear. But \none thing I noticed, my 8-year-old iMac is not suitable to really do \nextensive animation, probably have to really consider buying a new Mac \nsoon.<\/p>"},"id":"e5e5b2f0-1c1f-42ae-898e-13cae9ec0a18","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
