Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>With my plan on doing animations, I thought about my Portfolio\/Factory section which should really have some sort of comeback. I mean it would be nice to collect all these things I created somewhere and display them nicely. For a second I really thought about buying a WordPress Theme with a portfolio already included because right now I don\u2019t feel like creating the portfolio part of my page myself. BUT with a quick search through possible themes, I once again realized that most themes have always been something I don\u2019t like or are much too bloated.<\/p><p>So I probably end up doing something myself and keeping it simple for starters.<\/p>"},"id":"8a8c25d7-fb77-4da6-877b-8eb661c517db","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
