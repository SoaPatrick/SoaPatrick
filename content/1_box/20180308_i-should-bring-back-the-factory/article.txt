Old: With my plan on doing animations, I thought about my Portfolio/Factory section which should really have some sort of comeback. I mean it would be nice to collect all these things I created somewhere and displayed nicely. For a second I really thought about buying a Wordpress Theme with a portfolio already included because right now I don’t feel like creating the portfolio part of my page myself. BUT with a quick search through possible themes, I once again realized that most themes have always something I don’t like or are much too bloated.

So I probably end up doing something myself and keep it simple for starters.
