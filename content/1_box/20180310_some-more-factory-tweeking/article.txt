Still, the detail page is missing because I don\u2019t have any idea yet on how to construct them. I\u2019m thinking about making them look different than the regular single post view and then there\u2019s the issue of having several images for a Factory Item and how to display them. I still wanna avoid using jQuery and some fancy slider, so maybe just thumbnails with a lightbox? I don\u2019t know and until I do know, the simple Factory overview will stay that way.<\/p><p>But it was fun to collect all the previous things I\u2019ve done and display them in a fancy way, and I think there are a few more I missed. Plus the two short movies I\u2019ve made are missing because the source video is in such a bad quality that it\u2019s hard to create a good-looking preview image.<\/p>"},"id":"4c12f5f9-bde1-47a1-9ab9-534a41931295","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
