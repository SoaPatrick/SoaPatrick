Oh my, I was on schedule to get in shape for summer, for bike and hiking season, and now this! Somehow I gained some weight over the last month and now I have to put on some extra hours on the bike at home to get back on track.

I actually wanted to write more and draw less, but drawing the cartoon took a lot longer, in fact, it tookÂ soooo long that the battery of my iPad and Apple Pencil drained so fast that I couldn't really finish it. But then it's late and I want to go to bed. Maybe more tomorrow, I'm just glad I drew something today. Horray Me!
