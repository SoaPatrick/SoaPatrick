I\u2019m a sucker for red, always love the color but I really started pushing it the last few years of my life, be that clothes, accessories, furniture, colored walls and so on. Funnily I hardly made web designs with red, so I think it\u2019s time to change that. Combining red with black is an obvious choice since the two colors go so great together. I\u2019m also brainstorming about the general structure of a new theme and I think a more simple, clean and mobile-first approach is the way to go.<\/p><p>I think the main reason for a new design is the shift of focus on what I plan on doing, so that has to be represented on this new theme. I look forward to small design decisions each week.<\/p>"},"id":"270c4d10-dd5e-46d6-b13f-9c7cf6bd7371","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
