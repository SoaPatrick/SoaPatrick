Today everything is green because obviously, it's **St.Patrick's Day** and that has to be celebrated, especially if you're named Patrick. So since around this morning I updated the page with a special green Design, it was fun doing that and rather easy, but don't worry everything will go back tomorrow. I also drew something special for today, it was an old cartoon Image I made of myself but I updated it and improved it slightly. I'm learning something every time which is quite nice.

So that would be all for today because tonight I will go celebrate, I mean St.Patrick's Day on a Saturday? Perfect!
