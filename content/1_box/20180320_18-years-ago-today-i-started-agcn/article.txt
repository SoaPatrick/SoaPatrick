Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Wow, one of my first big Web pages just got old enough to vote, damn I\u2019m getting old. I\u2018ve had homepages before, most notably the Jennifer Love Hewitt Fanpage <strong>The Love Chronicle<\/strong> and <strong>The Love Corner<\/strong> but on March 20th of 2000 the Winona Ryder Fanpage <strong>And God Created Noni<\/strong>, or <strong>AGCN<\/strong> short, celebrated its birth. It was an interesting journey where I met interesting Winona fans from all over the world (even met some face-to-face on vacation in San Francisco). But it wasn\u2018t just me who met people. <strong>The Soap Community<\/strong> was a place for people to talk about anything and for some, it was a place where they found love.<\/p><p>I thought it would be fitting to dedicate this day once again to AGCN. The last version, before I took it offline in October 2006, is still <a href=\"https:\/\/agcn.soapatrick.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">online<\/a> along with the complete picture gallery. There are also <a href=\"https:\/\/agcn.soapatrick.com\/pictures\/categories.php?cat_id=6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Comic drawings<\/a> from French Artist <a href=\"http:\/\/mapage.noos.fr\/herval\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Herval<\/a> who did, among other things, four Anniversary Comics.<\/p><p>Ah, the good old days. It makes me proud to see what I achieved back then. After all, it was back then that I fell in love with designing and creating websites. I remember how I annoyed everyone by constantly changing the design of AGCN. Through AGCN I also got into WordPress, I think I started using it around version 1.7 or so.<\/p>"},"id":"7af39f2b-16fa-4468-b033-3bef91e165b4","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["agcn-2nd-anniversary.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"true","ratio":"","crop":"false","align":"default"},"id":"da94d381-3a96-46ab-b841-d5e6e103ef05","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I still have tons of updates in hardcoded HTML files from before \nusing WordPress.
