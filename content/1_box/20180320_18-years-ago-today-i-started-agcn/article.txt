Old: Wow, one of my first big Web pages just got old enough to vote, damn I'm getting old. I‘ve had homepages before, most notably the Jennifer Love Hewitt Fanpage **The Love Chronicle** and **The Love Corner** but on March 20th of 2000 the Winona Ryder Fanpage **And God Created Noni**, or **AGCN** short, celebrated its birth. It was an interesting journey where I met interesting Winona fans from all over the world (even met some face to face on a vacation in San Francisco). But it wasn‘t just me who met people. **The Soap Community** was a place for people to talk about anything and for some, it was a place where they found love.

I thought it would be fitting to dedicate this day once again to AGCN. The last version, before I took it offline in October 2006, is still [online](https://agcn.soapatrick.com/) along with the complete picture gallery. There are also [Comic drawings](https://agcn.soapatrick.com/pictures/categories.php?cat_id=6) from French Artist [Herval](http://mapage.noos.fr/herval/) who did, among other things, four Anniversary Comics.

Ah, the good old days. It makes me proud to see what I achieved back then. After all, it was back then when I fell in love with designing and creating websites. I remember how I annoyed everyone by constantly changing the design of AGCN. Through AGCN I also got into Wordpress, I think I started using it around version 1.7 or so.

I still have tons of updates in hardcoded HTML files from before using Wordpress. I want to include all into this blog to have a complete archive of all (well not all, but like 90%) my Blog Posts from the last 18 Years. I will get to that someday, hopefully.
