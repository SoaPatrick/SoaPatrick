I’m trying new styles when drawing faces, this time I tried to overemphasize certain things and go a bit to the extremes. It was drawn rather fast once I had that specific drawing but getting there was frustrating, still playing around with stuff and trying to draw things I’m imagining but that’s the hard part. Having that blank canvas in front of me scares me and sometimes puts too much pressure on me to deliver something incredible. But on that last one, the one on the featured image, I was finally able to let loose and just go a bit crazy. So maybe I need to let loose more before drawing the next time.
