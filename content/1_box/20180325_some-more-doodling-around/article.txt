So I tested different versions of it, different head-shapes mostly to see what works best. I also tested different ears and shapes for the ears. I must say I\u2019m happy with the different versions and I have some favorites but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m done with the \u2018finding my style\u2019 process yet. But it\u2019s fun to just draw around and test different things. I tried different noses and eyes but I kinda like the simple style, especially when the next step would be to animate it. Sooner or later I will move on to body parts, add arms and hands with fingers and try different things there as well. The cool thing is that all this gives me practice and I think I get faster with certain things. The last one (which is one of my favorites) was drawn very fast actually because I had certain things down on how to draw it.<\/p>"},"id":"de37f47f-9bda-4602-9b5a-e44883a3df17","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
