Just a quick update for today. Actually, I wanted to make an even short status update but then while drawing I had such a blast with these that I decided to post them as today's Blog post. The reason I chose this specific version from (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/03/some-more-doodling-around/ text: yesterdays post target: _blank) was the simplicity and of it and because it was the final drawing I did yesterday and I loved the outcome, so I wanted to go further with it. I still hesitate with going onto different body parts or different angles but I'm close to taking that next step. Too bad time on a Monday is in such short supply or else I would draw even more, well have to wait until tomorrow.
