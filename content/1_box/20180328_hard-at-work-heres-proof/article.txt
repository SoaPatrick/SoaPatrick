Old: With the limited time I have at home, besides work, having a social life and you know the essentials like sleeping and eating, I'm working hard toÂ draw things. Thank god the overly long Easter-Weekend is ahead of me so that I can find a bit of time to do a few long overdue chores, my apartment is a mess, and also find some much needed time to get productive, in a serious way.

In the meantime here's proof that I'm not being lazy and watching tons of shows on Netflix (Pssssst, **Santa Clarita Diet** Season 2 is really awesome!)

I could go further with this funny sketch but there's so much else to do and I still want to flex just a tiny bit on the sofa before going to bed so, this is all you get for tonight, deal with it!
