Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I cleaned the whole apartment today and now I\u2019m exhausted but while doing that I did some brainstorming about the new Theme I will start working on, someday\u2026 in the foreseeable future, hopefully. I\u2019m looking for fonts, I\u2019m looking for simple ways to display a blog post and I\u2019m making a list of things I need to think about when I\u2019m creating it, things I forgot for the current theme. So while doing that, I stumbled upon a possible issue: the featured Images I\u2019m currently creating for blog posts are all only 1000 pixels wide, which is not much when you want to display the image either above or below the title and spread it over the whole width of the text. I\u2019m currently thinking of 1250 Pixel and then all my recently created images since January 2018 are slightly too small. I need to think of a clever solution for this problem, maybe resize them or something like this.<\/p><p>Anywhoo that\u2019s all for today, the cleaning took a toll on me so I need to rest a bit.<\/p>"},"id":"bc0508d7-5384-43ec-9b81-d5a249ccdafd","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
