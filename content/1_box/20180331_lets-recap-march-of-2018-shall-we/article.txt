But I\u2019m not complaining because this was also the month I discovered or realized what I actually wanna do in my spare time. It was a big relief and so far I haven\u2019t changed my mind or thought that I should do something else after all. Sure it might sometimes look like I\u2019m not fully committing but I am. I started to get into drawing cartoon characters, which for me is something that actually has to get better and more refined with a twist of my own style in order to really do animations. So I keep doing that, keep thinking of short jokes or stories to tell in comic form before then going further and actually animating it (for which I really need a new Mac).<\/p><p>I\u2019ve done quite an amount of drawings this month which was really fun and I plan on doing many more in April and even playing around with different characters, hopefully? You know so far I\u2019ve made cartoon characters of me but I don\u2019t plan on doing animations about me so there have to be other characters. But give me time and I will get there.<\/p><p>So there\u2019s that. What else? It was fucking cold this month and it\u2019s only now getting slightly warmer. I\u2019m just happy when I can finally hang my winter jacket back into the closet. But with today\u2019s climate, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there won\u2019t be a real spring but jump from winter right into hot and unbearable summer. So here\u2019s hope that we at least get one or two months of nice warm weather before it gets too hot.<\/p>"},"id":"a1e28277-94c1-47fb-9192-138d6e01bb7c","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
