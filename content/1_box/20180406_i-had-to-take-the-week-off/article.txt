So Instead of doing that on a daily basis, I thought \u201clet\u2019s just take a break and do other things\u201d. It felt good to not think about what to write for a week. During that period, I realized that I should change the schedule to a more relaxing and productive one. Meaning I\u2019m thinking about writing only once or twice a week and using the rest of the week to work on my drawings, like today\u2019s featured image which was actually done rather fast, I think two hours top. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no possibility for more than two blog posts per week if I have enough to say or show but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m expecting.<\/p><p>Then there\u2019s the preparation for SoaPatrickFive. I resized the template for the featured Images to 1250x600px which I use starting today. Maybe I will resize the older ones as well (if it\u2019s possible) but it\u2019s not that urgent yet. Mmmm maybe I should even go full retina on the featured image and double the pixel density? I mean if I change why not change to 2500\u00d71200, that way I\u2019m prepared for any occasion. I have to think about that for a bit.<\/p>"},"id":"90c55a38-6c48-42d2-a0dc-d460cca9aaa8","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
