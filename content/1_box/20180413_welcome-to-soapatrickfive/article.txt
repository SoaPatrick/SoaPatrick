Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Wow, that went fast, I started yesterday evening with a clear vision in my head and now, around 20 hours later, the first version of that vision is released. Now, this is not the final version as I will continue to work on this Theme, but I thought I release a very simple one now and then build on top of that, instead of releasing it months and months later when it <strong>might<\/strong> be finished.<\/p><p>I know it\u2019s dark and it\u2019s Red and it\u2019s very simple, the structure is so much simpler, that I deleted a ton of code and files. As for now I will stop babbling about the theme and try to enjoy the weekend a bit. Maybe I will go into further details tomorrow or Sunday or whenever I feel like it.<\/p>"},"id":"e2dc214d-6abf-45c7-b07b-4790a67e8288","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
