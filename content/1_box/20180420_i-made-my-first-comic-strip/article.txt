This week was the birthday of a very good friend of mine, so I bought her a gift, obviously, and decided to draw a possible outcome of me giving her the gift as a Comic Strip, and giver her that as well. I took me around **10 hours** to draw and colorize it but the end result is worth it. (the final result in hi-res can be seen (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/flurina-birthday.png text: here target: _blank)) The interesting was publishing it on Instagram where you flip through the six panels by swiping. I really think (link: https://www.instagram.com/SoaPatrick/ text: Instagram target: _blank)Â is a cool way to publish comics in panel form (well rather easy square ones of course).

Of course, this was a rather special occasion and maybe I won't colorize them all, but I won't make a six-panel comic strip that quick again but rather reduce the number of panels to three. On the other hand, it can be more difficult to reduce a joke down to three images but then I have to get creative which is also fun.

On a side not. I did some more tinkering with the theme (all can be check out in the [Log](/log)) so just in case you think I haven't been doing much lately.
