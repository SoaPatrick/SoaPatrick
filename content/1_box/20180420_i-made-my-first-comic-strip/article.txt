It took me around <strong>10 hours<\/strong> to draw and colorize it but the end result is worth it. The interesting was publishing it on Instagram where you flip through the six panels by swiping. I really think <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/SoaPatrick\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram<\/a> is a cool way to publish comics in panel form (well rather easy square ones of course).<\/p><p>Of course, this was a rather special occasion and maybe I won\u2019t colorize them all, but I won\u2019t make a six-panel comic strip that quick again but rather reduce the number of panels to three. On the other hand, it can be more difficult to reduce a joke down to three images but then I have to get creative which is also fun.<\/p><p>On a side note. I did some more tinkering with the theme (all can be checked out in the <a href=\"\/log\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Log<\/a>) so just in case you think I haven\u2019t been doing much lately.<\/p>"},"id":"09e8b655-472c-4df9-af53-6233cac7fbc5","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
