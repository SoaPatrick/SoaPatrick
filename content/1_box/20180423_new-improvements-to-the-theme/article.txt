Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I Was busy this weekend with the theme and there are some visible changes. First of all, there\u2019s a navigation now, it\u2019s not the most innovative but the simplest one for the time being. I might tinker with it some more soon (the <strong>scroll to the top<\/strong> could be removed since it\u2019s kinda buggy). Then there are new pages done, there\u2019s an <a href=\"\/storage\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Archive<\/a>, a <a href=\"\/tags\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tag Archive<\/a>, a <strong>Search<\/strong>, a <strong>ListView<\/strong> and a way to quickly and easily update the color theme for the whole page (Welcome late to <strong>Earth Day<\/strong>).<\/p><p>Well, this is it for the moment, I have to switch to doing some drawings again after all the page is supposed to be a showcase for my work but it felt good doing some design work on the page and at the same time keeping the easy and simple look. Though one thing that might still be done this week is the <strong>Factory<\/strong> in order to properly showcase all my work. Oh and in case you\u2019re wondering if the page stays green now, of course not, will be switching back tomorrow. Red\u2019s my color!<\/p>"},"id":"aa756289-8b17-4046-85c9-f8b0d22373cb","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
