Old: Yes yes yes... there's a Countdown up top and no it's not for a special release I'm planning here but rather for the release of **Avengers: Infinity War**. It's probably the most hyped, anticipated and will be the biggest movie of the year and when that countdown hits zero, I will be sitting in the theatre and enjoying the movie. Was all anxious yesterday to get my tickets, to get my favorite seats.

I actually wanted to draw something for this subject but it's been rather busy at work and then there's Champions League tonight, but maybe I find the time to draw during the football match. Oh, and the theme will stay Purple because of **Thanos**, obviously!
