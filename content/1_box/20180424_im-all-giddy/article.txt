Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Yes yes yes\u2026 there\u2019s a Countdown up top and no it\u2019s not for a special release I\u2019m planning here but rather for the release of <strong>Avengers: Infinity War<\/strong>.\n It\u2019s probably the most hyped, anticipated and will be the biggest movie\n of the year and when that countdown hits zero, I will be sitting in the\n theatre and enjoying the movie. Was all anxious yesterday to get \nmy tickets, to get my favorite seats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually wanted to draw something for this subject but it\u2019s been \nrather busy at work and then there\u2019s Champions League tonight, but maybe\n I find the time to draw during the football match. Oh, and the theme \nwill stay Purple because of <strong>Thanos<\/strong>, obviously!<\/p>"},"id":"63e40642-42a5-449c-96b1-e706444547a2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
