Old: For the third time within a bit more than a year, I use the phrase **The Soap Factory just opened its doors**. The first time in (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2017/01/1687/ text: January 2018 target: _blank)Â and then again early this year in (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/03/the-soap-factory-just-opened-its-doors-once-again/ text: March target: _blank). I know it's getting tired of me closing and opening it again and again but I'm hoping to have it stay open now. I also added all the recent drawings I've made.

I'm having a good pace right now for doing work on the page, each day something small but I won't be able to keep it up. The final piece that's missing and kinda urgent is the Factory Detail Page. I don't have an idea yet on how to structure that with all it's pieces, but maybe I have an epiphany during a warm shower. It wouldn't be the first time.
