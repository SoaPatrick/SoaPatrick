Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>For the third time within a bit more than a year, I use the phrase <strong>The Soap Factory just opened its doors<\/strong>. The first time in <a href=\"\/box\/1687\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">January 2018<\/a> and then again early this year in <a href=\"\/box\/the-soap-factory-just-opened-its-doors-once-again\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">March<\/a>. I know it\u2019s getting tired of me closing and opening it again and again but I\u2019m hoping to have it stay open now. I also added all the recent drawings I\u2019ve made.<\/p><p>I\u2019m having a good pace right now for doing work on the page, each day something small but I won\u2019t be able to keep it up. The final piece that\u2019s missing and kinda urgent is the Factory Detail Page. I don\u2019t have an idea yet on how to structure that with all its pieces, but maybe I have an epiphany during a warm shower. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time.<\/p>"},"id":"f18a1bec-9ec0-4de2-851b-083187785614","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
