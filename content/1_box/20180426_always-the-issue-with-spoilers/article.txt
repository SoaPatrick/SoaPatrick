I\n did this first with <strong>Avengers: Age of Ultron<\/strong> then again with <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2<\/strong> and then again last year with <strong>Star Wars The Last Jedi<\/strong>.\n When I finally do see the trailer after having seen the movie, I\u2019m \nalways glad that I went through this process because Trailers tend to \nshow so much. Seeing certain scenes for the first time or not being able\n to put together a possible plot is such a refreshing thing. Usually, I \nwatch the Teaser (which of course only teases and doesn\u2019t really show \nmuch) and then realize that I don\u2019t need to see anything else because I \nwill go see it anyway.<\/p> <p>This time I avoided everything from <strong>Avengers Infinity War<\/strong> (btw only 24 hours to go!!!). I\u2019ve seen the <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/6ZfuNTqbHE8\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Teaser<\/a> though but not the <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/QwievZ1Tx-8\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trailer<\/a>\n or any TV Spots and I haven\u2019t even checked RottenTomatoes to see what \nthe rating is or read any reactions on Twitter. So I have another 24 \nhours to last until I can get blown away with hopefully lots of <strong>awesomeness<\/strong>.\n During this time I tend to avoid certain websites and be super careful \nwith Youtube Ads or TV Spots, would be a bummer to get spoiled in any \nway so close to the finish line.<\/p>"},"id":"8be6f757-fe0f-4911-a2dc-6de27d02a9d8","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
