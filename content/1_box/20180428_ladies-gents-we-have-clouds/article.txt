Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>What I did today with the header was actually something I wanted to do from the start, but I didn\u2019t know how to do it exactly, so I decided to postpone it and do other stuff first. Today I had some time and an idea in my head on how to do it and three hours later it was published on the live page.<\/p><p>I\u2019m not 100% sold on the arrangement of the clouds or bubbles or whatever you see, so I might play around with them some more. The responsive behavior is another issue but I will find a solution and stick to SVG Images to have a fully retina-capable website. I agree that with the Red theme it kinda looks hellish but I just love that color combination.<\/p><p>Oh and maybe I find the time tomorrow to talk a bit about Avengers Infinity War.<\/p>"},"id":"304ad91a-dd49-49b9-a5ec-2f90c38dcca0","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
