Another month has passed and I dialed it down quite a bit, **11 Posts** this month. I know it's a lot less than the usual 30 per month but I think it's for the better. So let's see what else happened this month? Well, because of posting less I had more time to do other stuff, so the big thing was certainly the release of **SoaPatrickFive** and the continues improvements I added over the course of the last two weeks. I mean the (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/log/ text: Log target: _blank) is full of changes. I had a blast with it and I'm really digging the result so far and I'm also having fun improving it.

I try to be as retina friendly as possible, that's why I use a lot of vector graphics and even increased the size of the Featured Images. They are now created in a resolution of **2500x1200 Pixel**. A canvas this big will hopefully keep me from using any stock photos EVER. Instead, use drawings or my own shot Photos (like the one from today). I just thought I'd take a size that will last for some time in case somewhere down the line I need bigger Featured Images.

I was also working on some Cartoons, not as much as I hoped for, but with SP5 my mind and creativity was busy somewhere else. But I hope the theme will take a back seat and let the drawing process take over a bit in May. The big thing this month was a (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/04/i-made-my-first-comic-strip/ text: 6-Panel Comic Strip target: _blank). It was a rather big challenge but a fun learning experience. I try to do more but with fewer panels.

Now let's look ahead a bit. The theme is in a good condition, the next step will be to see how future creative things can be presented the best way. I'm talking about **more cartoons** and hopefully also some **animations**. That will be the next big thing here, besides some small theme tinkering on the side. Apart from that, I do want to draw a lot more this coming month and maybe start writing stories which then can be turned into small short animations. So far there is no timeline for new iMacs so I have to keep busy with what I have now.

And finally a small info on stats, meaning how many people visit my blog. Well, it's interesting how that progresses actually. I had **79** hits (_36 unique_) in February, **143** hits (_50 unique_) in March and now **409+** hits (_170 unique_) in April.  So in order for people to come back and visit I have to continue producing cool content on a regular basis. I will try and do that.
