I know it\u2019s a lot less than the usual 30 per month but I think it\u2019s for the better. So let\u2019s see what else happened this month? Well, because of posting less I had more time to do other stuff, so the big thing was certainly the release of <strong>SoaPatrickFive<\/strong> and the continued improvements I added over the course of the last two weeks. I mean the <a href=\"\/log\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Log<\/a> is full of changes. I had a blast with it and I\u2019m really digging the result so far and I\u2019m also having fun improving it.<\/p><p>I try to be as retina-friendly as possible, that\u2019s why I use a lot of vector graphics and even increase the size of the Featured Images. They are now created in a resolution of <strong>2500\u00d71200 Pixel<\/strong>. A canvas this big will hopefully keep me from using any stock photos EVER. Instead, use drawings or my own shot Photos (like the one from today). I just thought I\u2019d take a size that will last for some time in case somewhere down the line I need bigger Featured Images.<\/p><p>I was also working on some Cartoons, not as much as I hoped for, but with SP5 my mind and creativity was busy somewhere else. But I hope the theme will take a back seat and let the drawing process take over a bit in May. The big thing this month was a <a href=\"\/box\/i-made-my-first-comic-strip\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6-Panel Comic Strip<\/a>. It was a rather big challenge but a fun learning experience. I try to do more but with fewer panels.<\/p><p>Now let\u2019s look ahead a bit. The theme is in a good condition, the next step will be to see how future creative things can be presented the best way. I\u2019m talking about <strong>more cartoons<\/strong> and hopefully also some <strong>animations<\/strong>. That will be the next big thing here, besides some small theme tinkering on the side. Apart from that, I do want to draw a lot more this coming month and maybe start writing stories which then can be turned into small short animations. So far there is no timeline for new iMacs so I have to keep busy with what I have now.<\/p><p>And finally, a small info on stats, meaning how many people visit my blog. Well, it\u2019s interesting how that progresses actually. I had <strong>79<\/strong> hits (<em>36 unique<\/em>) in February, <strong>143<\/strong> hits (<em>50 unique<\/em>) in March and now <strong>409+<\/strong> hits (<em>170 unique<\/em>) in April. So in order for people to come back and visit I have to continue producing cool content on a regular basis. I will try and do that.<\/p>"},"id":"0c212c9b-2939-4a4f-8c76-ca9098b723a1","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
