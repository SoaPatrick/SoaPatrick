I think Infinity War is best described as the <strong>Season Finale<\/strong> of Season 3 (or Phase Three when speaking in Marvel Cinematic Universe terms). So the anticipation was high and the movie delivered on all fronts. It\u2019s a 2 hours and 40 minutes movie and there is no slow moment or a scene I think could be cut. It\u2019s an amazing thrill ride with a gut-punch ending. I\u2019m not going into details here and this is not supposed to be a review, I\u2019m not qualified enough to really review a movie.<\/p><p>So what is this then? Well, a reason to showcase my latest work and express how I felt watching the movie. The movie really shocked me and it took me some time to process what I saw on both an emotional and spectacle level. So I sat down today and decided to draw the star of the movie: <strong>Thanos<\/strong>. There\u2019s also an idea for a short comic strip so that one might follow soon.<\/p><p>So if you\u2019ve seen your share of Marvel movies and you liked them, go check it out, preferably on a big screen. It\u2019s an event you can\u2019t miss. Watching this nice put-together <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/U5sb8LBeaQQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">summary<\/a> helps to catch you up on all the important things for Infinity War.<\/p>"},"id":"92a19452-5ec4-4db4-926e-fd8753e71a97","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
