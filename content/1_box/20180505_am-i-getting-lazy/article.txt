Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>It seems that I\u2019ve settled on how my drawings look like and recently it has become a quick <strong>copy\/paste job<\/strong>\n and that\u2019s why all my drawings look the same, at least to me. I don\u2019t \ntake risks or try new things, I stay within my comfort zone and I need \nto break out of it, fast!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, not all drawings have to be new and groundbreaking, that \nwould put too much pressure on me, but trying different styles and \ndrawing new things should be the main goal now. I will try to deliver \nthat.<\/p>"},"id":"6714288e-f297-4cdc-afa8-502290ebdaab","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
