I hesitated a long time with the Airpods because people look kinda funny wearing them, and they still do, but having used them for a while now I can admit they are awesome.<\/p><p>The ease of use, the extremely small form factor, the fully cordless design, are all points which make the headphones a dream to use and wear. Of course, they don\u2019t offer the same sound quality as Earbuds or Over-Ear headphones but they are perfect for a sunny day and going for a walk without the hassle of a cord.<\/p><p>The ability to quickly switch between my iPhone and iPad during commuting is another nice touch as is the case to store and at the same time charge the headphones. I have to charge the case maybe once a week while the headphones themselves get charged every time I put them into the case. It\u2019s just a very well-thought-out product and one I can recommend very easily.<\/p>"},"id":"48075cbf-86d7-4591-9c7e-9f26dc5d3b03","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
