I stumbled upon some drawing books I've found in one of my boxes in the cellar: [Drawing Dynamic Comics](https://www.amazon.de/Drawing-Dynamic-Cutting-Watson-Guptill-Paperback/dp/0823003124/) and [Drawing Cutting Edge Comics](https://www.amazon.de/Drawing-Cutting-Edge-Comics-Christopher/dp/0823023974). Then I also found [Inspired 3D Short Film Production](https://www.amazon.de/Inspired-3D-Short-Film-Production/dp/1592001173), a book I bought for one of the classes in school, that one might be helpful. And I bought [Creating Characters](https://www.amazon.de/Draw-Jazza-Creating-Characters-Cartoons/dp/1440344949) from Draw with Jazza, that one as an eBook, plus [The Animator's Survival Kit](https://www.amazon.de/Animators-Survival-Kit-Principles-Classical/dp/086547897X) which is on its way. The goal here is clear, study the whole drawing process and practice as much as possible. I need to learn the basics in order to draw faster and more freely.

I know it's a lot and I hope I find the time (reading on the train is simply not possible, I fall asleep as soon as I read a few lines) but in the end, if this whole animation thing is really that important to me then I will make time!
