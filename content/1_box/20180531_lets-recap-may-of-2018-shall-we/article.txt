Long time no see. I know, I know, I took a break. But that doesn't mean I wasn't working at all. In fact, I was busy at work, I also did some sketches (not as many as I hoped) like one for Deadpool. I also optimized the Logo and used the **Golden Ratio** to perfectly balance the **S** and the **P**. Then there was the sudden urge to take some pretty pictures with my **Sony Alpha 5000** (like the one above). I'm just shocked that I never really got to learn the basic settings of a camera and what can be achieved with them until now. Like what to do with the **Aperture**, the **Shutter Speed** and the **ISO**.

So it seemed like a quiet month and one might be right and I've noticed that recently too and started to think about how to change that because I ended up **consuming more** than actually **producing content**. I wanted to write a Blog entry on this subject but on well... I seem to have had better things to do. So I realized that giving myself more freedom on how often I write Blog entries was contra productive and I guess this means back to the **daily blogging routine**? Back to get into the habit of doing something daily. I will give it a shot and see how it goes.

So I will leave it at that and enjoy my well deserved evening, it was a stressful but productive weekend, too bad it was all work related.
