I know, I know, I took a break. But that doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t working at all. In fact, I was busy at work, I also did some sketches (not as many as I hoped) like one for Deadpool. I also optimized the Logo and used the <strong>Golden Ratio<\/strong> to perfectly balance the <strong>S<\/strong> and the <strong>P<\/strong>. Then there was the sudden urge to take some pretty pictures with my <strong>Sony Alpha 5000<\/strong> (like the one above). I\u2019m just shocked that I never really got to learn the basic settings of a camera and what can be achieved with them until now. Like what to do with the <strong>Aperture<\/strong>, the <strong>Shutter Speed<\/strong> and the <strong>ISO<\/strong>.<\/p><p>So it seemed like a quiet month and one might be right and I\u2019ve noticed that recently too and started to think about how to change that because I ended up <strong>consuming more<\/strong> than actually <strong>producing content<\/strong>. I wanted to write a blog entry on this subject but on well\u2026 I seem to have had better things to do. So I realized that giving myself more freedom on how often I write Blog entries were contra-productive and I guess this means back to the <strong>daily blogging routine<\/strong>? Back to get into the habit of doing something daily. I will give it a shot and see how it goes.<\/p><p>So I will leave it at that and enjoy my well-deserved evening, it was a stressful but productive weekend, too bad it was all work-related.<\/p>"},"id":"1d37d746-2faa-4c80-a334-d8e2dc67a33f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
