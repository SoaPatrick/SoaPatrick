Old: I thought about how to move forward, improve my drawing skills and make a fun game out of it which keeps me drawing daily. I remembered the [30 Day Drawing Challenge](https://www.soapatrick.com/2017/02/30-day-drawing-challenge/) I did last year and how much I learned but also how stressful it became to draw something daily. So I thought I change some tiny bits with that approach and make it easier to approach it daily.

So let me introduce the **100 Day 10 Minutes Drawing Challenge**. Wait, what? **100 Days!?!?** Yap, BUT, with a time limit of **10 minutes** of drawing per day. So Everyday for the next 100 days, I will draw something with a timer set to 10 minutes. Once the timer has run out I stop. I can continue of course if I feel like it but I don't have to. 10 minutes per day seems doable.

I'm not gonna publish all my results, only the ones I feel good about, obviously. So starting **today** (right after the Apple Keynote) I will draw daily and hopefully improve my drawing skills and I will also post status updates once in a while with certain results.
