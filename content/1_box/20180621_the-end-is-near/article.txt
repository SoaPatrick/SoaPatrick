Old: No not the end of this place here, rather the end of the work project meaning more time again for this place and I kinda look forward diving into my **own little world** again. In the meantime, I will continue drawing my daily challenge (on day 16 now). Here is yesterday's challenge, even though it was a day late because his Birthday was on June 19th.
