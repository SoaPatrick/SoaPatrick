Apart from that, it was a somewhat productive month with my <strong>100 Day Drawing Challenge<\/strong> (currently on day 25) and the design project at work which sucked up a lot of creative energy and it seems to go on a bit further. On the other hand, I need to learn to have multiple projects at the same time!<\/p><p>I was also drawing on real paper for once and bought myself a drawing book to draw in, but the pressure there is a lot higher because correcting something drawn with ink is not possible but it\u2019s a fun alternative to drawing on the iPad.<\/p><p>I also bought a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/stawix\/amsi-pro\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new font<\/a> for the headings, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfonts.com\/fonts\/radomir-tinkov\/qanelas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">old one<\/a> was nice and all but the non-upper-case style and the width of certain characters started to bother me, so I looked for a new font type and found one which I think looks much much better.<\/p><p>So what is the plan for July, the hottest month of the year? Post more, keep drawing and damn it <strong>start writing stories<\/strong> or just <strong>film stuff<\/strong> and don\u2019t worry about how good it is, I cannot improve if I never start something!<\/p>"},"id":"e9189be5-9f5d-4642-a80f-a595eb4a7dba","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
