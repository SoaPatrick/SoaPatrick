I feel like the number of posts per month is dropping rapidly (8 in May and only 4 in June) which is not a good sign and I need to change that fast, so that's one of my resolutions for July. Apart from that, it was a somewhat productive month with my **100 Day Drawing Challenge** (currently on day 25) and the design project at work which sucked up a lot of creative energy and it seems to go on a bit further. On the other hand, I need to learn to have multiple projects at the same time!

I was also drawing on real paper for once and bought myself a drawing book to draw in, but the pressure there is a lot higher because correcting something drawn with ink is not possible but it's a fun alternative to drawing on the iPad.

I also bought a (link: https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stawix/amsi-pro/ text: new font target: _blank) for the headings, the (link: https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/radomir-tinkov/qanelas/ text: old one target: _blank) was nice and all but the non-upper-case style and the width of certain characters started to bother me, so I looked for a new font-type and found one which I think looks much much better.

So what is the plan for July, the hottest month of the year? Post more, keep drawing and damn it **start writing stories** or just **film stuff** and don't worry about how good it is, I cannot improve if I never start something!
