Old: After the (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/06/time-for-a-status-update/ text: first 12 day recap target: _blank), it was time to look back on the next 12 days on my way to the **100 Day Drawing Challenge**. I must admit on some days it was rather difficult to get motivated and I think it shows in some of the thumbnails. But on the other hand, there were days where I've drawn like 5 different things and but none for the challenge, so I ended up with a simple one for the challenge because I was just exhausted after drawing for several hours straight. The style of emphasizing the drawing with the **color red** has disappeared as I have tested out new things. Overall I'm happy with the latest batch.

I hardly stop after 10 minutes which is ok for me because the time limit is to get started in the first place. So like last time, I want to highlight a few days again. First a shoutout to Day 15 and **Garfield** which received its (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/06/the-end-is-near/ text: own blog post target: _blank). I just love the little guy.

Then I went crazy with the black on (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/100daydrawingchallenge-day-17.png text: Day 17 target: _blank) with another one of my attempts of a self-portrait in a different style. This one was actually done first on paper with a pencil and ink before I've redrawn it on the iPad. Maybe I went a bit crazy with the shadows in the face.

On (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/100daydrawingchallenge-day-20.png text: Day 20 target: _blank) I've drawn how I probably look like every day on my ride home from work. It was fun to draw a face from a somewhat funny and different angle and after a few tries, I even got a half decent hand.

And last another self-portrait on (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/100daydrawingchallenge-day-21.png text: Day 21 target: _blank) this time a more realistic but still comic-style approach. People told me I look so mean, well yes I need to work on different facial expressions. Cannot look like a grumpy old man all the time.

So that's day 13 to 24. I'm currently on day 27 so I finish today's post here and get back to drawing.
