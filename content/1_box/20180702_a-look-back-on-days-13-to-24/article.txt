Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>After the <a href=\"\/box\/time-for-a-status-update\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first 12 day recap<\/a>, it was time to look back on the next 12 days on my way to the <strong>100 Day Drawing Challenge<\/strong>. I must admit on some days it was rather difficult to get motivated and I think it shows in some of the thumbnails. But on the other hand, there were days where I\u2019ve drawn like 5 different things and but none for the challenge, so I ended up with a simple one for the challenge because I was just exhausted after drawing for several hours straight. The style of emphasizing the drawing with the <strong>color red<\/strong> has disappeared as I have tested out new things. Overall I\u2019m happy with the latest batch.<\/p>"},"id":"960a8b9d-8c8f-442a-9ac8-bc952238a1f7","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["100daydrawingchallenge-13-24-days.png"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"true","ratio":"","crop":"false","align":"default"},"id":"9cfc5949-9a45-4ad6-9c6f-694a1dd79909","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I hardly stop after 10 minutes which is ok for me because the time limit is to get started in the first place. So like last time, I want to highlight a few days again. First a shoutout to Day 15 and <strong>Garfield<\/strong> which received its <a href=\"\/box\/the-end-is-near\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">own blog post<\/a>. I just love the little guy.<\/p><p>Then I went crazy with the black on <a href=\"\/box\/a-look-back-on-days-13-to-24\/100daydrawingchallenge-day-17.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Day 17<\/a> with another one of my attempts of a self-portrait in a different style. This one was actually done first on paper with a pencil and ink before I\u2019ve redrawn it on the iPad. Maybe I went a bit crazy with the shadows in the face.<\/p><p>On <a href=\"\/box\/a-look-back-on-days-13-to-24\/100daydrawingchallenge-day-20.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Day 20<\/a> I\u2019ve drawn how I probably look like every day on my ride home from work. It was fun to draw a face from a somewhat funny and different angle and after a few tries, I even got a half-decent hand.<\/p><p>And last another self-portrait on <a href=\"\/box\/a-look-back-on-days-13-to-24\/100daydrawingchallenge-day-21.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Day 21<\/a> this time a more realistic but still comic-style approach. People told me I look so mean, well yes I need to work on different facial expressions. Cannot look like a grumpy old man all the time.<\/p><p>So that\u2019s day 13 to 24. I\u2019m currently on day 27 so I finish today\u2019s post here and get back to drawing.<\/p>"},"id":"65b6d4b0-425b-4fb4-852d-114b6042e535","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
