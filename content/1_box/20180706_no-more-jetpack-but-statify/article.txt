Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>With the recent General Data Protection Regulation <strong>(GDPR)<\/strong> or <strong>DSGVO<\/strong> in German, I had to check if I need to change something with my own website here. After some research about the subject and WordPress itself, I realized that WordPress doesn\u2019t save personalized information about visitors unless you register (of course) and since this page has no way to register to leave comments I was fine for the basic WordPress part.<\/p><p>But then I used a plugin for tracking hits and page views called <a href=\"https:\/\/jetpack.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jetpack<\/a>. I think the main reason I installed it was so that I could write markup text for Blog entries. Well, Jetpack is a huge thing and does so many things and I got a headache just reading into this. Long story short, I didn\u2019t want to invest more time and I especially didn\u2019t want to <strong>add a disclaimer<\/strong> to the page (those things are a designer's nightmare). So I removed Jetpack and instead use the very lightweight plugin <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/statify\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Statify<\/a>.<\/p><p>So now you and I are in the clear\u2026 thank god that\u2019s settled.<\/p>"},"id":"cb957c44-fa19-4c9b-bca3-4c50b4c49497","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
