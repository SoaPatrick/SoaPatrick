Old: With the recent General Data Protection Regulation **(GDPR)** or **DSGVO** in German, I had to check if I need to change something with my own website here. After some research about the subject and Wordpress itself, I realized that Wordpress doesn't save personalized information about visitors unless you register (of course) and since this page has no way to register to leave comments I was fine for the basic Wordpress part.

But then I used a plugin for tracking hits and page views called [Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/). I think the main reason I installed it was so that I could write markup text for Blog entries. Well, Jetpack is a huge thing and does so many things and I got a headache just reading into this. Long story short, I didn't want to invest more time and I especially didn't want to **add a disclaimer** to the page (those things are a designers nightmare). So I removed Jetpack and instead use the very lightweight plugin [Statify](https://wordpress.org/plugins/statify/).

So now you and I are in the clear... thank god that's settled.
