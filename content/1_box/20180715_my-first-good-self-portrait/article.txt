I've been drawing now for 40 days in the **100 Day Drawing Challenge** and I'm passed the moment where I draw for just 10 minutes a long time ago. But who cares right? I'm drawing that's what counts. Well on Friday I started with a new attempt on a self-portrait and more than **two hours** later I was done and really really really happy with it. It just looks like me. Well, there's also a speed drawing **video**. The ear was probably the hardest thing to draw, as you can see in the video by how often I changed it or completely redrawn it.
