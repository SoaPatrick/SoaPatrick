I must confess, I wasn't drawing the last few days for the **100 Days Drawing Challenge** because I was trying something new. I decided to stop making up any more excuses and just shoot a short clip. So I stood up very early on my day off and just walked around town and filmed stuff with my iPhone. I didn't have any expectations on the final result, all that mattered for me was a learning experience and I can't get any better if I never start in the first place.

So I shot some stuff and just by editing and looking at the footage at home, I already knew what to do better next time around. For example, **better compositions** (I was way too worried about not filming people or coming off as weird than looking at the frame). Also **get a tripod**, a real one so that I can see whats being shot at all times (the small Gorilla Pod has its advantages but for low angle shots it's a pain in the ass to frame it). And **continuity**, think about a story in images and shoot the film accordingly.

Then there was the editing process, and I will go into that once I post the video. So I leave you with a nice Behind the Scenes still.
