I decided to stop making up any \nmore excuses and just shoot a short clip. So I stood up very early on my\n day off and just walked around town and filmed stuff with my iPhone. I \ndidn\u2019t have any expectations on the final result, all that mattered for \nme was a learning experience and I can\u2019t get any better if I never start\n in the first place.<\/p> <p>So I shot some stuff and just by editing and looking at the footage \nat home, I already knew what to do better next time around. For example,\n <strong>better compositions<\/strong> (I was way too worried about not filming people or coming off as weird than looking at the frame). Also <strong>get a tripod<\/strong>,\n a real one so that I can see whats being shot at all times (the small \nGorilla Pod has its advantages but for low angle shots it\u2019s a pain in \nthe ass to frame it). And <strong>continuity<\/strong>, think about a story in images and shoot the film accordingly.<\/p> <p>Then there was the editing process, and I will go into that once I \npost the video. So I leave you with a nice Behind the Scenes still.<\/p>"},"id":"04509f7a-2166-4712-b72f-6510ee179277","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
