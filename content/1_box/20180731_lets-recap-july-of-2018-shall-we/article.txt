Well, the weather had a lot of impact on my motivation over the last two weeks, but first, let\u2019s start with the good stuff.<\/p><p>I decided to <a href=\"\/box\/shooting-a-short-video\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shoot<\/a> something with the iPhone and actually did it, including <a href=\"\/box\/video-editing-is-a-hassle\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">editing<\/a> the footage afterward. Like I mentioned I had some problems but I loved the learning experience and the plan is to do something again this weekend (if the temperature in my apartment is bearable).<\/p><p>On the flip side, the <strong>100 Days Drawing Challenge<\/strong> was put on hold for the time being, after 43 days straight I came to a halt for various reasons, the switch to a filming project was one and the constant heat another. Once the temperatures go down to a reasonable level, I will start drawing again and pick it up on day 44. I also bought the Book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.de\/Things-Draw-Journal-Chronicle-Books\/dp\/0811876446\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">624 Things to Draw<\/a> to get some ideas on what to draw.<\/p><p>So now I have to get back to doing nothing and try to cool down.<\/p>"},"id":"8c58af2a-6759-441e-98ef-a681fbfdaa40","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
