I wasn’t wrong when I (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/06/lets-recap-june-of-2018-shall-we/ text: said target: _blank) in last month's recap that July will be the hottest month of the year, but it seems that the high temperatures will go on at least for another 2 weeks. Well, the weather had a lot of impact on my motivation over the last two weeks, but first, let’s start with the good stuff.

I decided to (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/07/shooting-a-short-video/ text: shoot target: _blank) something with the iPhone and actually did it, including (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/07/video-editing-is-a-hassle/ text: editing target: _blank) the footage afterward. Like I mentioned I had some problems but I loved the learning experience and the plan is to do something again this weekend (if the temperature in my apartment is bearable).

On the flip side, the **100 Days Drawing Challenge** was put on hold for the time being, after 43 days straight I came to a hold for various reasons, the switch to a filming project was one and the constant heat another. Once the temperatures go down to a reasonable level, I will start drawing again and pick it up on day 44. I also bought the Book (link: https://www.amazon.de/Things-Draw-Journal-Chronicle-Books/dp/0811876446 text: 624 Things to Draw target: _blank) to get some ideas on what to draw.

So now I have to get back to doing nothing and try to cool down.
