Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>With the latest WordPress Update, there was the possibility to use a new Editor with the note that it will become the default Editor with version 5.0 (soon to be released I guess). The new Editor is called <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/gutenberg\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gutenberg<\/a> and seems to be an attempt to catch up with all those drag and drop builders. Big changes are highly controversial, same as with this one, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/gutenberg\/#reviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">plugin reviews<\/a>. So I tested it out myself and I noticed that first, it\u2019s a tad too overblown for my needs and second it\u2019s a lot more complex at first sight. the other problem is the styling. My theme is not able to hand all the changes and there lies now the question, shall I make the necessary changes to my theme so that I can safely use Gutenberg with all its features (most of them I will never need) or should I stick with the basic and simple one for the time being?<\/p><p>I think for now I will stick with what I\u2019m used to, for a <strong>SoaPatrickSix<\/strong> I see myself using a much more refined Gutenberg Editor and have all possibilities designed<\/p>"},"id":"36bf8a6c-d980-47a5-8edf-453d3f64dbbd","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
