Old: After a few frustrating days of finding a story for my (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/08/im-trying-to-put-something-together/ text: micro/short film project target: _blank), it suddenly made click this weekend, thanks to some tasty drinks (love myself a **Blackberry Bourbon Smash**) and a bit of brainstorming with a friend. The basic premise is there and a possible end which I really like as well as some key story beats. The next step would be to flesh out the story and characters a bit more, come up with the **Logline** and then be ready for the next steps in the pre-production process: Screenplay, Storyboards, Location Scouting, Castings, Shooting Schedule and so on!

As soon as I'm ready and comfortable I will post the Logline, maybe there will be a title as well, I have some ideas in my head already.
