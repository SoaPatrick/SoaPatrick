Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>After a few frustrating days of finding a story for my <a href=\"\/box\/im-trying-to-put-something-together\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">micro\/short film project<\/a>, it suddenly made click this weekend, thanks to some tasty drinks (love myself a <strong>Blackberry Bourbon Smash<\/strong>) and a bit of brainstorming with a friend. The basic premise is there and a possible end which I really like as well as some key story beats. The next step would be to flesh out the story and characters a bit more, come up with the <strong>Logline<\/strong> and then be ready for the next steps in the pre-production process: Screenplay, Storyboards, Location Scouting, Castings, Shooting Schedule and so on!<\/p><p>As soon as I\u2019m ready and comfortable I will post the Logline, maybe there will be a title as well, I have some ideas in my head already.<\/p>"},"id":"00596ee4-59d0-49a1-a572-1226477cfadd","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
