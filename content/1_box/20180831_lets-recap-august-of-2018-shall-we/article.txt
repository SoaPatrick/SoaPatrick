So what happened this month? Well, a lot! It all started with the <a href=\"\/box\/im-trying-to-put-something-together\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">plan<\/a> to <strong>write<\/strong> and <strong>shoot<\/strong> a micro\/short film. Since then I\u2019ve been doing lots of research for <strong>shooting procedures<\/strong>, for <strong>renting equipment<\/strong> and kept my mind busy with the basic shape and scope of the story.<\/p><p>I set myself a deadline for the story which is actually today. So how far have I come? Well, I\u2019d say the story is pretty much set, there are some details and minor kinks which I need to iron out during the <strong>scripting process<\/strong> but generally, I feel comfortable with what I have in order to take the next step. I now have an entire month for the <strong>screenplay<\/strong>, the <strong>storyboards<\/strong> and <strong>planning<\/strong> the shooting schedule. As for the promised \u2018Logline\u2019, I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing that yet, also because I haven\u2019t really written it but I do have an idea floating in my head. I can share the title though:<\/p><p><strong>\u201cMOVIE NIGHT\u201d<\/strong><\/p><p>I know it sounds generic but I think it fits the story quite well. There\u2019s also an idea for a <strong>poster<\/strong> which I\u2019ve sketched. I know that I shouldn\u2019t worry that much about things like the poster but I had an idea in my head that fits perfectly so why not create that poster.<\/p><p>I think that\u2019s all for this recap because apart from that nothing worthy of writing down here has happened.<\/p>"},"id":"4e9f268b-6e40-4158-86d0-9166818f790c","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
