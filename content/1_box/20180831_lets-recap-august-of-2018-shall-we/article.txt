Another month has passed which means time for the usual recap. So what happened this month? Well, a lot! It all started with the (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/08/im-trying-to-put-something-together/ text: plan target: _blank) to **write** and **shoot** a micro/short film. Since then I've been doing lots of research for **shooting procedure**, for **renting equipment** and kept my mind busy with the basic shape and scope of the story.

I set myself a deadline for the story which is actually today. So how far have I come? Well, I'd say the story is pretty much set, there are some details and minor kinks which I need to iron out during the **scripting process** but generally, I feel comfortable with what I have in order to take the next step. I now have an entire month for the **screenplay**, the **storyboards** and **planning** the shooting schedule. As for the promised 'Logline', I don't feel comfortable sharing that yet, also because I haven't really written it but I do have an idea floating in my head. I can share the title though:

**"MOVIE NIGHT"**

I know it sounds generic but I think it fits the story quite well. There's also an idea for a **poster** which I've sketched. I know that I shouldn't worry that much about things like the poster but I had an idea in my head which fits perfectly so why not create that poster.

I think that's all for this recap because apart from that nothing worthy of writing down here has happened.
