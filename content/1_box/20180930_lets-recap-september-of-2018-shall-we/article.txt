Other things I ordered online, like <strong>lighting<\/strong> and some small stuff to help me get the shots I want. But for future projects, I need my own camera. Unfortunately, the <strong>Canon EOS 5D Mark IV<\/strong> (the camera I rented) has a 4K Crop and doesn\u2019t shoot high frame rates in 4K or 1080p and I\u2019d love to have 2 or 3 <strong>slow motion shots<\/strong>.
