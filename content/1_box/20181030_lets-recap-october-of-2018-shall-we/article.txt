In a way, I did (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/10/movie-night-my-first-real-short-film/ text: my recap target: _blank) two days ago with an in-depth look back on the making of my first short film **"Movie Night"**. But I want to keep up this year's tradition of a monthly recap (at least for another two months).

It was a special month, having three weeks off from work (which allowed me to make this short film), receiving the good news of having a new job much much closer to home next year and of course also my birthday (I’m now in my last year in my 30s).

Apart from the short film, I also started to make a lot more pictures with my **Sony a5000**. It was a good practice to get to know the 3 most important settings: **Aperture**, **Shutter Speed** and **ISO**. But I also got frustrated with the limitations of that camera, especially in low light conditions, that’s why a new camera will be purchased soon. I know that the kit lens isn’t the best and with a better lens I might make better pictures in low light, but I rather invest into a better camera and better lenses now than stick with a 5-year-old camera with lots of limitations.

Ok, I was about to go into other things, but the Apple Event just finished and ... **WHAT THE FUCK APPLE!?!?!?** No new iMac? The currently sold iMacs are **512 days old**, yet the prices remain the same. I'm disappointed and currently out of ideas of what do to next.
