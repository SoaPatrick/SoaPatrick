But I want to keep up this year\u2019s tradition of a monthly recap (at least for another two months).<\/p><p>It was a special month, having three weeks off from work (which allowed me to make this short film), receiving the good news of having a new job much much closer to home next year and of course also my birthday (I\u2019m now in my last year in my 30s).<\/p><p>Apart from the short film, I also started to make a lot more pictures with my <strong>Sony a5000<\/strong>. It was a good practice to get to know the 3 most important settings: <strong>Aperture<\/strong>, <strong>Shutter Speed<\/strong> and <strong>ISO<\/strong>. But I also got frustrated with the limitations of that camera, especially in low light conditions, that\u2019s why a new camera will be purchased soon. I know that the kit lens isn\u2019t the best and with a better lens I might make better pictures in low light, but I rather invest in a better camera and better lenses now than stick with a 5-year-old camera with lots of limitations.<\/p><p>Ok, I was about to go into other things, but the Apple Event just finished and \u2026 <strong>WHAT THE FUCK APPLE!?!?!?<\/strong> No new iMac? The currently sold iMacs are <strong>512 days old<\/strong>, yet the prices remain the same. I\u2019m disappointed and currently out of ideas of what do to next.<\/p>"},"id":"b15b7b54-a1da-420d-afb6-e29f9cdb8569","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
