Old: I‘ve been thinking a lot about the next project (obviously), which will be shot this Saturday, and what kind of future projects I plan on doing. I once made the bold statement to a friend of doing at least **12 short movies** next year, one for each month, just to put pressure on myself with all these **deadlines**. I know that it‘s kinda crazy to do these once a month but my goal is not to have 12 huge projects lined up but rather just shoot 12 different movie projects (short or microfilm, a sketch or just something with an idea) to practice.

Because let‘s face it, right now the main goal has to be to **improve my skills** on every level and not worry about quality THAT much but rather just go out and do stuff on a daily, weekly or monthly basis and get better every time. Let me worry about quality later on when I‘m on a level the good ideas get the treatment they deserve.
