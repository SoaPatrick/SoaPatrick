Yeah, I know that currently, it seems that all I do is write recaps and maybe another post in between. But a lot has been happening in the last two months. The good news of a <strong>new job<\/strong>, the start of actually <strong>making movies<\/strong> and this month two new things happened. The first one is <strong>my second movie<\/strong> which I will talk about in-depth in a day or two and then there\u2019s the <strong>new home office<\/strong> I\u2019m working on, so let\u2019s talk about that a bit.<\/p><p>Yeah, I was disappointed when Apple didn\u2019t announce a new iMac at their October 30th Event in New York because the iMac was always the machine I was planning on purchasing as my new workstation. So I was in a bit of a pickle. Buy an 18-month-old iMac with outdated processing power and I\/O ports or look for something else? Well, I did a lot of thinking and decided against old tech. So this update now is written on a <strong>Mac Mini<\/strong> with a <strong>6-Core i7 Processor<\/strong>, <strong>512 fast SSD<\/strong>, and <strong>32GB of RAM<\/strong>. As for a monitor, since I used an iMac before I had to get a new monitor and opted for a <strong>27-inch 4k display<\/strong> from Dell (there was a really good offer on Black Friday). There\u2019s also a <strong>WD My Book Duo<\/strong> with a Raid 1 and 4Terabytes of storage for external Project Storages (finished projects will be moved to the external storage and only current ones stay on the Mac Mini).<\/p><p>There are further things that I plan on buying, but one step at a time. There\u2019s the need for an <strong>eGPU<\/strong>, a <strong>second 4k Display<\/strong>, and some updated peripherals. The reason I picked the Mac Mini over the iMac was the number of <strong>Thunderbolt 3<\/strong> ports the Mac Mini offers, four compared to only two, and therefore the ability to upgrade the Mac Mini in a modular way.<\/p><p>So far I\u2019m happy with the performance of editing a Full HD Video but the real test will be <strong>4K Footage<\/strong> which is not far away because a new Camera has been ordered. But I\u2019d say that\u2019s it for this month's recap, like I said, a more detailed post about my second Short Film will follow soon.<\/p>"},"id":"80eb5a07-6176-40c7-ba0f-0383ecc8b79c","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
