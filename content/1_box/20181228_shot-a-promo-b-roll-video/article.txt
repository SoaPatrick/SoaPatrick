When you watch a lot of youtube videos you see a lot of so-called <strong>B-Roll<\/strong>, so I thought I\u2019d give it a try.<\/p><p>The video was shot in <strong>100p<\/strong> with only <strong>16mbps<\/strong> bitrate. The <strong>SQS Mode<\/strong> on the camera allows me to see the footage right away in slow motion on the camera compared to the 100mbps in the regular Movie Mode. That way I could immediately see if the footage was usable or not and saved me some time. Maybe there\u2019s a way to see the 100p 100mbsp footage slowed down to 24p on the camera as well and I just haven\u2019t found out how to achieve that.<\/p><p>I also tried to play with<strong> angles<\/strong>, <strong>pans<\/strong> and <strong>zooms<\/strong> to achieve a more dynamic video. Certain shots were harder to achieve by doing everything alone, like the spinning coaster while panning the camera, but for the more complex shots, I got help from a friend which saved me some time and made it possible to get specific shots I had in my head.<\/p><p>I think it was a great first try with doing a <strong>B-Roll video<\/strong> and I know what to look for in future projects (maybe record in 100mbsp because somehow the video looks a bit fuzzy on Youtube, oh well). I also tried my hands on an <strong>animated Instagram Story<\/strong> to promote the video. They are cool to look at but need extra time which needs to be planned on set as well, same with interesting Behind the Scenes pictures.<\/p><p>There was one set up for the <strong>overhead shot<\/strong> where I put the glass on the coaster which looked really cool with the <strong>tripod<\/strong>, the <strong>slider<\/strong> mounted on the tripod, the camera mounted on the side of the slider and then the <strong>monitor<\/strong> connected to the camera to know what\u2019s in the frame and what\u2019s in focus. BUT I forgot to take a picture of it, well I have to remind myself to do that next time.<\/p>"},"id":"512b83b5-ab5e-4c5c-b1e4-9f9db3b9828e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
