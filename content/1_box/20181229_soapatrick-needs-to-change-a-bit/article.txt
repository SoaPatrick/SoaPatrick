Old: Now that I plan on doing more video work on a monthly basis (maybe even weekly) this place needs to **change** a bit and reflect those projects a lot better than just being part of a new Blog entry.

I thought in the past about doing some sort of **landing page** with the **latest Video** or Factory Item and **Blog entry** being highlighted and the Blog being a subpage of the whole website. That also means of course finally adding a factory item **detail view** because just having an image there means nothing, everything I did for the factory deserves some more information.

But there's the time issue because doing that needs **time**, time I currently rather spend on doing a new short film or just a new video in general. There's also the thought of doing a complete new design (**SoaPatrickSix**) which also incorporates the newly release (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/08/wordpress-will-have-a-new-editor/ text: Gutenberg Editor target: _blank). The Wordpress Theme (link: https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/16/introducing-twenty-nineteen/ text: TwentyNineteen target: _blank) could be a new base for such a theme, But that would take even more time. I guess I have to do some thinking on what's more important and who knows, maybe I will once again use a **third party theme** which does everything already to save me time.
