Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Now that I plan on doing more video work on a monthly basis (maybe even weekly) this place needs to <strong>change<\/strong> a bit and reflect those projects a lot better than just being part of a new Blog entry.<\/p><p>I thought in the past about doing some sort of <strong>landing page<\/strong> with the <strong>latest Video<\/strong> or Factory Item and <strong>Blog entry<\/strong> being highlighted and the Blog is a subpage of the whole website. That also means of course finally adding a factory item <strong>detail view<\/strong> because just having an image there means nothing, everything I did for the factory deserves some more information.<\/p><p>But there\u2019s the time issue because doing that needs <strong>time<\/strong>, time I currently rather spend on doing a new short film or just a new video in general. There\u2019s also the thought of doing a complete new design (<strong>SoaPatrickSix<\/strong>) which also incorporates the newly release <a href=\"\/box\/wordpress-will-have-a-new-editor\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gutenberg Editor<\/a>. The WordPress Theme <a href=\"https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/core\/2018\/10\/16\/introducing-twenty-nineteen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TwentyNineteen<\/a> could be a new base for such a theme, But that would take even more time. I guess I have to do some thinking on what\u2019s more important and who knows, maybe I will once again use a <strong>third-party theme<\/strong> that does everything already to save me time.<\/p>"},"id":"1b52faaf-1a10-40a7-b551-b0cb1832d2de","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
