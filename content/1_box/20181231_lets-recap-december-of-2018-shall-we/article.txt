I released two videos this month, though technically <a href=\"\/box\/juicy-finish-a-new-short-film\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Juicy Finish<\/a> was done in November, came up with some ideas for <strong>future movie projects<\/strong> and took a lot of pictures (latest one being today\u2019s featured image) to get to know the camera. So apart from <strong>Juicy Finish<\/strong> (which was shot on my old <strong>Sony a5000<\/strong>) I recently released a Promo Video for <a href=\"\/box\/shot-a-promo-b-roll-video\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zum Lange Inseli<\/a> with my <a href=\"\/box\/got-myself-a-new-camera\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new Camera<\/a> the Sony a7III. It was a fun experience and shows that I\u2019m on the right track by just doing videos and don\u2019t worry too much about the quality (though with the upcoming \u2018Reflection\u2019 Short Film I\u2019m currently preparing I notice that I\u2019m starting to think too much about <strong>compositions<\/strong> instead of choosing something and go with it).<\/p><p>Besides being a busy month it was also an <strong>expensive<\/strong> month with my <a href=\"\/box\/lets-recap-november-of-2018-shall-we\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new Workstation<\/a> and all that comes with it and all the <strong>moviemaking gear<\/strong> I bought. But I do think I\u2019m prepared for the new year to put those new toys to work. I don\u2019t have any excuses anymore to <strong>NOT<\/strong> make something.<\/p><p>But I think that\u2019s it for this month's recap, especially since a more detailed recap of the whole year is planned for the next few days. So now it\u2019s time for me to get ready for a chilling evening among friends. This is the moment where I say <strong>goodbye to everyone<\/strong>, have a nice evening and a good start into the new year, see you on the other side\u2026<\/p>"},"id":"a3d8095a-36a6-4832-94b3-6be215efd22b","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
