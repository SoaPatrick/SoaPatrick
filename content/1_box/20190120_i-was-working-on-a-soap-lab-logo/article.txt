Old: As I mentioned in my previous Post, I had the Idea to make all my movie projects under a new banner called **Soap Lab Experiment**. Now roughly two weeks later I can present you the first version of set Logo. I was playing around with different fonts and colors and style and all before I came to this version and I REALLY really like how it turned out. The whole thing has been done in **Illustrator** which is really handy to have. I was also drawing some things with my i**Pad Pro** connected to my mac using **Astro Pad**. The color Pink is a nod to **Fight Club**, obviously. There were different color versions and with different background colors as well but this one was the one that stuck out the most. I might animate the flask in the future but for now, this is it. After all, I need to make movies in order for me to actually use it, so time to make some movies!

So now it's time to actually shoot **Reflection** which will be done either today or tomorrow. So fingers crossed that all works out so that I can publish it this month.
