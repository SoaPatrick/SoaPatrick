Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>As I mentioned in my previous Post, I had the Idea to make all my movie projects under a new banner called <strong>Soap Lab Experiment<\/strong>.\n Now roughly two weeks later I can present you the first version of \nset Logo. I was playing around with different fonts and colors and style\n and all before I came to this version and I REALLY really like how it \nturned out. The whole thing has been done in <strong>Illustrator<\/strong> which is really handy to have. I was also drawing some things with my i<strong>Pad Pro<\/strong> connected to my mac using <strong>Astro Pad<\/strong>. The color Pink is a nod to <strong>Fight Club<\/strong>,\n obviously. There were different color versions and with different \nbackground colors as well but this one was the one that stuck out the \nmost. I might animate the flask in the future but for now, this is it. \nAfter all, I need to make movies in order for me to actually use it, so \ntime to make some movies!<\/p>"},"id":"bd040c61-46e5-4bcc-90b3-d6f84f101367","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["soaplab.png"],"src":"https:\/\/www.soapatrick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/soaplab-750x900.png","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"true","ratio":"","crop":"false","align":"default"},"id":"84cea6a1-84de-442c-868d-683c6cfe0a14","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>So now it\u2019s time to actually shoot <strong>Reflection<\/strong> which will be done either today or tomorrow.
