Old: When I [posted](https://www.soapatrick.com/2019/01/why-not-a-look-ahead/) about my plans for 2019 there was one about walking through **every street** in Basel-City. Well after one month I think I'm already making lots of progress. So I took an image of the current status and keep in mind that it was January, meaning it's cold and once it gets warmer I will walk around **a lot more**. So when you look at it I think this could be done by OctoberÂ already. But of course, it's not about how fast but what I discover on this journey. There are a lot of **nice buildings** I've already seen thanks to the fact that I actually look at my surroundings instead of just walking with **blinders** on, not knowing what's around me.

Progress from January, looks like a face with a hat
