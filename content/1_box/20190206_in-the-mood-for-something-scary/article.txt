Ok let me explain, I had this idea for some time now (I think it all started in [December](https://www.soapatrick.com/2018/12/lets-recap-december-of-2018-shall-we/)) and I actually shot **three different versions** on three different weekends. The general idea was to shoot something simple and **all alone** and try to use **masking** for special effects. While shooting the second weekend I had a different idea which now turned into the final result. Shooting alone was an **interesting** yet **complicated** experience. Not knowing how a shot turned out until I rewatch it was time-consuming, also that I couldn't properly **block** scenes because I didn't know how it looked when there was no one I could use as a stand-in.

So with the last idea, there was suddenly a **second** actress and with that came the realization that I need more help, so with the help of an **additional** friend we **shot** the movie on Saturday within 6 hours. I **cut** the movie together on Sunday and on Monday I started to **edit the music**, which was the most important aspect of this short film. The idea was always to create a scary mood with **sound**, and not have jump scares and light flickering and whatever you find in today's trashy horror films.

So I hope you all enjoy it, the **feedback** I've received so far is that people were feeling uneasy when watching it and that was the main goal, so I say this **Soap Lab Experiment** was a success.
