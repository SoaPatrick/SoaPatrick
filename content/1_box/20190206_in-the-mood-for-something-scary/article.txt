The general idea was to shoot something simple and <strong>all alone<\/strong> and try to use <strong>masking<\/strong> for special effects. While shooting the second weekend I had a different idea which now turned into the final result. Shooting alone was an <strong>interesting<\/strong> yet <strong>complicated<\/strong> experience. Not knowing how a shot turned out until I rewatch it was time-consuming, also that I couldn\u2019t properly <strong>block<\/strong> scenes because I didn\u2019t know how it looked when there was no one I could use as a stand-in.<\/p><p>So with the last idea, there was suddenly a <strong>second<\/strong> actress and with that came the realization that I need more help, so with the help of an <strong>additional<\/strong> friend we <strong>shot<\/strong> the movie on Saturday within 6 hours. I <strong>cut<\/strong> the movie together on Sunday and on Monday I started to <strong>edit the music<\/strong>, which was the most important aspect of this short film. The idea was always to create a scary mood with <strong>sound<\/strong>, and not have jump scares and light flickering and whatever you find in today\u2019s trashy horror films.<\/p><p>So I hope you all enjoy it, the <strong>feedback<\/strong> I\u2019ve received so far is that people were feeling uneasy when watching it and that was the main goal, so I say this <strong>Soap Lab Experiment<\/strong> was a success.<\/p>"},"id":"723701f7-3ed6-4fe9-815f-904bb1f7be3d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
