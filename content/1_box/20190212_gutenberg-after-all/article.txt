Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I was trying out the new <strong>Gutenberg<\/strong> Editor for a project at work and I think it improved quite a bit since my first <a href=\"\/box\/wordpress-will-have-a-new-editor\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">test<\/a> with it back in <strong>August<\/strong>. I was so pleased with how it worked that I decided to implement it here. I made a quick <strong>test<\/strong> with the basic elements and it works quite nicely but more testing and adding new <strong>styling<\/strong> rules are required. So I will incorporate it very <strong>soon<\/strong> and use it for the <strong>Factory Detail<\/strong> view and maybe for the <strong>landing page<\/strong> as well.<\/p>"},"id":"3ae09c5b-0be6-4211-9d0f-aa9a8439312d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
