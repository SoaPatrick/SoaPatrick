I played around with the camera this weekend. First I did take some cool (link: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bui-vD_laXR/ text: Photographs target: _blank) at dawn from the Roche Tower yesterday evening and today I wanted to play around with my lights at home and practice different kinds of lighting set-ups.

I recently purchased some color gels and a large light reflector which I all used today. Having a helping hand helps a lot because doing it all alone is VERY time consuming. Below are some of the best shots from this testing session:
