Old: Because making movies or short films or just videos right now is not that easy for me, I started to turn to photography. I mean I will be able to learn compositions in still photography as well and the reason I bought a **Sony a7III** and not a **Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4k**, which shoots better video, is because I wanted a great hybrid camera to shoot stills as well.

So here are a few examples of my last Sunday's stroll around Basel.

I still need to make a lot more pictures and try different things, I'm on one hand still a bit shy to take pictures with people around and I'm also still a bit boxed in when it comes to compositions, I need to break out of my comfort zone (artistically) and be creative.

I will be going to **London** soon and I hope that being in a HUGE city helps me to stop worrying about what people think when I take pictures and just do it.
