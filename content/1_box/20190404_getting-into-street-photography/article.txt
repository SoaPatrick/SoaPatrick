Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Because making movies or short films or just videos right now is not \nthat easy for me, I started to turn to photography. I mean I will be \nable to learn compositions in still photography as well and the reason I\n bought a <strong>Sony a7III <\/strong>and not a <strong>Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4k<\/strong>, which shoots better video, is because I wanted a great hybrid camera to shoot stills as well.<\/p> <p>So here are a few examples of my last Sunday\u2019s stroll around Basel.<\/p>"},"id":"7d310559-b5b7-459b-9f3a-c2b3028c5e7d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"columns":1,"lightbox":"true","align":"content","images":["street-photography_03.jpg","street-photography_01.jpg","street-photography_02.jpg"]},"id":"f1098018-dd5a-4000-885e-561bd2aa10fb","isHidden":false,"type":"gallery"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I still need to make a lot more pictures and try different things, \nI\u2019m on one hand still a bit shy to take pictures with people around and \nI\u2019m also still a bit boxed in when it comes to compositions, I need to \nbreak out of my comfort zone (artistically) and be creative.<\/p> <p>I will be going to <strong>London<\/strong> soon and I hope that being\n in a HUGE city helps me to stop worrying about what people think when I\n take pictures and just do it.<\/p>"},"id":"79a63b28-181a-4ba2-959d-4adb4b4297a2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
