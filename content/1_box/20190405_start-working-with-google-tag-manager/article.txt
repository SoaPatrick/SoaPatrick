Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>For work, I had to dive into <strong>Google Tag Manager<\/strong> which was for me a completely new area. It\u2019s a complex area but I think I slowly get the hang of it, even though it\u2019s not really my favorite subject but I thought in order to get even more out of it I could implement it here on my own website and play around with it.<\/p><p>It\u2019s amazing what can be tracked these days. What someone <strong>clicks<\/strong>, how far people <strong>scroll<\/strong>, what text they <strong>copy<\/strong>, how long they <strong>stay<\/strong> on an individual page and a lot more. Now I know that <strong>privacy<\/strong> is a big issue these days and don\u2019t worry, <strong>IF<\/strong> I start tracking all those things, I would let my few readers know. Then I would of course also <strong>anonymize<\/strong> the IP Address. I still have to do some research about an <strong>Opt-Out<\/strong> option.<\/p><p>But mostly I would be interested here in <strong>scrolling<\/strong> behavior (after all the page is rather long and it would be interesting to see how far down people scroll). Then of course the ratio between <strong>Mobile<\/strong> and <strong>Desktop<\/strong> users and what people click.<\/p><p>As I said, when the time comes I will write down in great detail what is being tracked, and maybe even explain why. So I will keep you guys posted on how this project is developing.<\/p>"},"id":"642acd05-26a4-4ffb-ad3c-2aa594702d41","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
