Old: Wait what? Did I miss something? No no, it's April I know, but still, the most important Winter is finally here. 8 more days and the most **anticipated** Season of all time will finally arrive.

Ok for those who have no idea what I'm talking about: **Game of Thrones** the last Season will start in 8 days with its final 6 episodes and conclude an epic saga an epic bang, hopefully. Full **two years** we had to wait since the last episode and now it's only 8 more days. I've been watching one episode per day for the last **60 days** in my 2 months long Game of Thrones marathon, and now I will watch the 7th Season with its 7 episodes which lead nicely to the first episode of the 8th Season next Monday.

It's one of the reasons I didn't have much time for much else the last two months, but **rewatching** all the episodes back-to-back was helpful to get once again up to date on what was happening and most of all who are all those people again.

If you've never seen Game of Thrones, you're missing out, definitely. It's definitely one of the **greats** when it comes to TV Shows. The production value is out of this world and the stories are told with so much care that it's a pleasure to watch it unfold.

But enough chit chat, time to watch another episode.
