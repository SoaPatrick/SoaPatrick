I know it's been a while since my last Blog post but first I was sick for a few days and then there was a quick trip to London for just a few days to just get out of Switzerland for a few days and see something different again.

Of course, the camera made the trip as well and the plan was to take as many photographs as possible. BUT I forgot how chilly London can be (this weekend is now a LOT warmer than last weekend, oh well) and so holding the camera for too long was not possible without freezing my hands off. But I did get some shots, not as much as I plan, but still.

As you can see it's mostly of buildings, I'm still not that comfortable taking pictures of scenarios with people and I still have to train my eyes to see interesting compositions. But I think these turned out quite nice.
