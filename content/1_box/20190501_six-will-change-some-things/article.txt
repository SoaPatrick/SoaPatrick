Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>It\u2019s subtle but there have been some slight changes to the page here. First I\u2019ve created a new theme, <strong>Version 6<\/strong>, which is now running this place. The base has been <strong>Version 5<\/strong> on which I make my changes. The goal is to use a more lean approach to the styling and let Gutenberg be the place to build Blog Posts.<\/p><p>Then there will be changes to the <strong>header<\/strong>, probably, making it less dominating and leaner so that the content is visible a lot earlier and faster. I\u2019m not sure how I will do that yet, but I\u2019m sure I will figure something out. Through all that process I will be using <strong>CSS Grid<\/strong> a lot more (the current blog post structure is already using it) and hopefully, this will allow me to get a more streamlined look throughout the page.<\/p><p>I will try to keep avoiding <strong>jQuery <\/strong>since I think websites can be built without that fancy framework, like I said, making it leaner is the main goal. Through that process I will have to go to all of the blog posts and clean them up a bit, especially put the <strong>Featured Image<\/strong> inside the blog posts (which gives me a lot more flexibility about its size) and rewrite the Quote, Link and Status Blog Posts in order to fully utilize <strong>Gutenberg<\/strong> for those kinds of Blog Posts<\/p><p>It\u2019s funny how much I started to like Gutenberg when I think back to my first impressions back in August last year.<\/p><p>While I was at it the last few days, I realized that the <a href=\"https:\/\/agcn.soapatrick.com\/pictures\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AGCN Picture Gallery<\/a> wasn\u2019t working anymore, so I had to fix that as well, but all is fine again now.<\/p>"},"id":"acd3e9e6-f9ca-4c83-b48a-1db04b75a737","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
