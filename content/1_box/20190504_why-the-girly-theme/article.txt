In my quest to improve upon version <strong>five<\/strong> I also played around with colors and with the possibility of a white, or light, theme.<\/p><p>For future theme switching, or whatever, I plan on using <strong>CSS variables<\/strong> and the ability to choose a <strong>light<\/strong> or <strong>dark<\/strong> theme and save those settings in a cookie. In the meantime, the theme will look whatever I feel like it should look.<\/p><p>I also played around with new buttons, not sure about them but I keep them for now, to see how I feel about them after a few days. I also optimized the mobile header.
