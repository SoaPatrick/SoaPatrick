Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Now that was a <strong>productive<\/strong> day, I kinda feel sad though that I spend the whole day in front of the computer, but when I see what I achieved I\u2019m kinda happy.<\/p><p>What I mentioned <a href=\"\/box\/why-the-girly-theme\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">yesterday<\/a> I did today. There\u2019s a new Icon in the navigation () which allows you to switch between a <strong>light<\/strong> or <strong>dark<\/strong> theme<\/p><p>I achieved that by using <strong>CSS Variables<\/strong>. There isn\u2019t a second stylesheet that gets loaded but I change <strong>three<\/strong> CSS Variables through Javascript and store that in <strong>HTML Local Storage<\/strong> so that the look keeps when you cruise around the website.<\/p><p>Then I added a WordPress Customization to my Theme, which allows me to change the Color through a <strong>Color Picker<\/strong>. Same with the dark\/light theme, all I do is change one single<strong> CSS Variable<\/strong> to change the color of the whole Page. The idea, I think, is to have different sections use different colors, but that\u2019s the plan for another day.<\/p>"},"id":"0f1ece4a-e744-4fbb-a7be-5ebf82906d6e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
