Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>\u2026 is something I think people do not cherish enough. It\u2019s only ever an issue when you\u2019re sick or you\u2019re in pain, then you yearn for the times you\u2019ve been healthy. I\u2019m just thinking about this issue a bit more recently because, on one hand, I am getting older, and I tend to feel my body a bit differently. Small things start to hurt and my body needs longer to heal, on the other hand, I\u2019m currently having some issues with my body because he doesn\u2019t act the way he\u2019s supposed to.<\/p><p>Now, of course, people might say I\u2019m overly whiny and because I\u2019m a man one might think I\u2019m exaggerating. Maybe I am a bit, but still, the feeling of getting older and the body not being as durable as it used to starts to creep up on me more and more.<\/p><p>The reason for a blog post about this subject is that I\u2019m currently in the midst of waiting for some test results. Now I don\u2019t want to sound too alarming, all the signs point to good news but still, make one think.<\/p><p>This entry might sound confusing but what I\u2019m trying to say, I think, is that people should cherish their health a lot more. Be grateful in the morning when nothing hurts, when you\u2019re feeling good, it\u2019s not taken for granted and certainly not forever. I try to live more consciously, I really try, but I still might fall back into the usual behavior, I think it\u2019s human nature.<\/p>"},"id":"27a46a63-6308-4e3a-bb46-1bc5232785e2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
