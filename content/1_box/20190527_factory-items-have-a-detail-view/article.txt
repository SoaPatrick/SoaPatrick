I will add some texts and relevant past blog posts to those items, later on, step by step. Then there are some items missing that will be added as well.<\/p><p>Since the Factory is growing there needs to be a way to categorize them and sort them by their category. Something is already in place but I haven\u2019t figured out how to get the result similar to Blog Post Tags.<\/p>"},"id":"0fee1bcd-733b-4dac-8892-bd856dbfc516","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
