Old: I was working hard on Sunday to finally expand the [Factory section](https://www.soapatrick.com/factory) to more than just a simple overview and have an actual detail view with more information and bigger Picture or Video.

Not all items have some information about its development, but I thought at least have the original image or the video shown. I will add some texts and relevant past blog posts to those items, later on, step by step. Then there are some items missing which will be added as well.

Since the Factory is growing there needs to be a way to categorize them and sort them by their category. Something is already in place but I haven't figured out how to get the result similar to Blog Post Tags.
