my Cat Grissu looking mean

I was working hard on this theme the last few days but today I realized (when I was trying to figure out how to create a better landing-page) that I need to stop for now. I mean a lot has been done and what's most important is the fully functional [Factory](https://www.soapatrick.com/factory/). But I need to focus on creating other things again.

So today I picked up the camera once again and while sitting on the balcony and enjoying the sun, I took a few shots from my cat. It seems she wasn't that thrilled, but she's a little diva and is hard to please.

Maybe I will take some more photographs this weekend, the weather sure will be nice.
