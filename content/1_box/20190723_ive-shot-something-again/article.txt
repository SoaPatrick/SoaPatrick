So I was happy that the last two weeks I actually shot <strong>two<\/strong> things. One will be ready to be released on <strong>Friday<\/strong> if all goes well. The other will be reshot this following weekend and probably needs another week of post-production until that one can be released.<\/p><p>So look come back on Friday for the release of <strong>Milk<\/strong>, that\u2019s what I call the first one for now.<\/p>"},"id":"d3fb1d5e-b3ce-4648-a479-c9e6f124b081","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
