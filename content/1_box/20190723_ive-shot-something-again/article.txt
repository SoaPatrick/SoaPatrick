Old: It's been a long time since I've shot something with my camera which wasn't a photograph, it was (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/factory/reflection/ text: Reflection target: _blank) way back in (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2019/02/in-the-mood-for-something-scary/ text: February target: _blank). So I was happy that the last two weeks I actually shot **two** things. One will be ready to be released on **Friday** if all goes well. The other will be reshot this following weekend and probably needs another week of post-production until that one can be released.

So look come back on Friday for the release of **Milk**, that's what I call the first one for now.
