The goal here was to get <strong>back into the game<\/strong>\n of shooting videos, making movies and for that, I was happy with \nanything.  I could have inserted some close-ups to spice things up but I\n wanted to keep it simple because this is only one of two videos I\u2019m \ncurrently working on.<\/p>"},"id":"74c24e4f-7124-4659-baa8-9f9540b9db5b","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["bad-milk-bts.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"true","ratio":"","crop":"false","align":"default"},"id":"08087621-af9f-413a-a624-cfee3370aa32","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The setup was rather easy, but because of shadows, the light had to come from above otherwise the stitching together of the two scenes wouldn\u2019t have worked. So I had <strong>one key light<\/strong> from above with diffusion in between to soften it.<\/p><p>Everything was shot in <strong>three takes<\/strong>, the first one was ruined by my <strong>cat<\/strong> who thought she had to star in <a href=\"\/box\/movie-night-my-first-real-short-film\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this movie<\/a> as well. It had to work with two takes because I didn\u2019t want to eat that many bowls of cornflakes.<\/p>"},"id":"7c8f9540-dfbb-4370-9542-deba6f0cb8f8","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"align":"content","location":"kirby","video":["bad-milk-outtake.mp4"],"url":"","caption":""},"id":"6b7d0d54-ba2e-43e7-92bf-b3d50a0d56d3","isHidden":false,"type":"video"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I did slow down my first take on the right at one point to match it \nwith the spitting on the left. I knew that beforehand so I tried to keep\n still to make it easier without anyone noticing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <strong>re-recorded<\/strong> all the sounds afterward because I was\n running out of tripods to mount the microphone above the table. But it \nwas a good experience. I picked the first song from the <strong>YouTube Music Library<\/strong>\n because it fitted perfectly for the mood and had the perfect length. I \ndid extend the beat at the end a bit for dramatic purposes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for color correction. I played around with quite a few different looks, but the <strong>Black and White<\/strong> with some <strong>grain<\/strong> fitted quite nicely to the mood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\u2019m happy to finally release a new video, even though it\u2019s a \nrather easy one. But I hope this puts me back on track to shoot more \nsmall videos again. Plus it shows that those videos can be easy too, but\n maybe not THAT easy again for the next ones.<\/p>"},"id":"86cc1a9f-3b4b-4114-818b-d0618d865a6a","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
