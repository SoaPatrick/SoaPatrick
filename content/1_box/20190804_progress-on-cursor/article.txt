I\u2019ve shot some material last Sunday with the help of a friend, and I\u2019m currently trying to cut it together. During that process, I realized that I need to <strong>reshoot<\/strong> certain scenes. (that\u2019s the beauty of shooting it almost all alone, I can plan them whenever I have time for that)<\/p><p>Of course, it\u2019s not ideal to reshoot scenes for every film I do once I cut it together, but that\u2019s the learning process I\u2019m currently in I guess. And sooner than later I hope I think of things when I\u2019m actually shooting and not editing it. Plus doing it all alone can be tedious and <strong>time-consuming<\/strong>, so certain things get <strong>forgotten<\/strong> or <strong>overlooked<\/strong>.<\/p><p>So the idea is to cut it together with what I have and then reshoot those scenes that need to be reshot with a much <strong>clearer vision<\/strong>.<\/p><p>On the plus side, I\u2019m also working on my <strong>next<\/strong> micro-film which will be more on the <strong>personal<\/strong> side. There\u2019s an idea that needs to be fleshed out a bit more and I even plan on writing a <strong>screenplay<\/strong> and drawing <strong>storyboards<\/strong>, I need to be better prepared when shooting movies.<\/p>"},"id":"dd44b69a-284e-4d89-99fa-b3225fbe1e8b","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
