I thought it would be a good idea to share some progress updates on **Cursor**, my next micro-film. I've shot some material last Sunday with the help of a friend, and I'm currently trying to cut it together. During that process, I realized that I need to **reshoot** certain scenes. (that's the beauty of shooting it almost all alone, I can plan them whenever I have time for that)

Of course, it's not ideal to reshoot scenes for every film I do once I cut it together, but that's the learning process I'm currently in I guess. And sooner than later I hope I think of things when I'm actually shooting and not editing it. Plus doing it all alone can be tedious and **time-consuming**, so certain things get **forgotten** or **overlooked**.

So the idea is to cut it together with what I have and then reshoot those scenes that need to be reshoot with a much **clearer vision**.

On the plus side, I'm also working on my **next** micro-film which will be more on the **personal** side. There's an idea which needs to be fleshed out a bit more and I even plan on writing a **screenplay** and draw **storyboards**, I need to be better prepared when shooting movies.
