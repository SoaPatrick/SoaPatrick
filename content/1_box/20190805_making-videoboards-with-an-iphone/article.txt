Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>In <a href=\"\/box\/progress-on-cursor\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">yesterday's<\/a> post, I talked about how I realize what shots I need once I cut something together. Today I found the song I want to use for <strong>Cursor<\/strong> and that changes the mood and the tempo of the movie so I need to rethink how I shoot and cut it together even more.<\/p><p>So instead of imagining how it looks in my head and then shooting it for real, why not make quick <strong>videoboards<\/strong> with my iPhone and cut it together with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/products\/premiere-rush.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adobe Rush<\/a> to get a sense of how it would actually look like.<\/p><p>It\u2019s quick, fast and easy to do directly on an iPhone. I think this could be my way of <strong>previsualizing<\/strong> scenes before actually shooting them plus it will also function as a shot list which is always handy.<\/p>"},"id":"0ae5041d-faf4-4f39-9fa9-9ce57c416f39","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
