Old: In (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2019/08/progress-on-cursor/ text: yesterdays target: _blank) post I talked about how I realize what shots I need once I cut something together. Today I found the song I want to use for **Cursor** and that changes the mood and the tempo of the movie so I need to rethink how I shoot and cut it together even more.

So instead of imagining how it looks in my head and then shoot it for real, why not make quick **videoboards** with my iPhone and cut it together with (link: https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html text: Adobe Rush target: _blank) to get a sense of how it would actually look like.

It's quick, fast and easy to do directly on an iPhone. I think this could be my way of **previsualizing** scenes before actually shooting it plus it will also function as a shot list which is always handy.
