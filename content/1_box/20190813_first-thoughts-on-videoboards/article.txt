Old: I did start on making videoboards with my **iPhone** and then editing them on the iPhone itself with **Adobe Rush** or sync it to my Mac and edit it there. It's still a pain to film myself and not really know if I'm in the shot or not, BUT then I adjust the angle and reshoot it quickly. There's no need to set focus because I shot everything in autofocus. Acting and continuation are also not that important. I even shot some stuff handheld. So all that makes it easy to get quick results and impressions on what works and what doesn't. But it's still something that I want to improve upon over time.

So what does this mean for **Cursor**? Since I'm rather busy during the weekdays this week, I hope to finish the videoboards this weekend and then shoot the real thing the weekend after. All this should make it possible to release it this August.
