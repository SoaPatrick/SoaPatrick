Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Today I finished the first <strong>Video Board<\/strong> cut for \nCursor and I had some problems with it at first because the movie will \nhave more cuts than any of my previous movies before. I spent a lot of \ntime moving scenes around in and nothing really satisfied me when I \nstarted to remember from some making-of videos and some tutorials that \neach cut needs to have <strong>a purpose<\/strong>. Why do you cut to that specific angle, what do you want to tell by showing the audience this and not that angle?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The moment I started to edit with that thought in my mind it got a lot easier. So that\u2019s what I take away from today, <strong>always cut with a purpose<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the actual cut itself, I\u2019m quite happy with it, I might tinker\n with it after I let it be for a day or two and look at it with fresh \neyes. But I\u2019m quite happy with the result and it gave me an easy \nshotlist for when I shoot it for real.<\/p>"},"id":"fb01a0e5-c46b-4abd-a83f-d222831e998f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
