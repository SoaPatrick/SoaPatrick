Old: I couldn't really keep myself from further work on this theme but it was so much fun to do this. Now you can not only switch between **Light** and **Dark** mode, no, now you can also choose your own **color theme**.

In the Settings window, you can choose between **6 colors** and of course that color gets saved in your browsers local storage, so when you come back later, the color and the dark/light mode are the same as last time.

The Settings window is also **draggable**, meaning you can move the window around with your mouse (touch is not supported).

With all those changes one could assume the page speed is suffering from all that, but I also did extensive work under the hood. In my last update I mentioned caching and performance so let me elaborate that a bit.

All the pages get rendered and saved as static html files, meaning no PHP server-side rendering is done instead you get a pure HTML file which makes the site really really fast. Then I also outsourced all the images to a CDN server and also used the new FontAwesome Kit function, which loads the icons from a CDN as well and only the ones in use.

All this leads to a Google Page Speed of friggin' **95 on Mobile and 99 on Desktop**. It may not mean much for you, but for me, this is a spectacular score (I was starting around 40 before I really invested in optimizing the site).

So hopefully I can now call this theme done and move on to other stuff.
