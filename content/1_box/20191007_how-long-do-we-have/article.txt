Old: This is not a philosophical question but rather the title of my next project. Yes, I have an idea and a title already and it's something I'm quite enthusiastic about. I will go into details of what this project is about in another blog entry, for now, I just have to announce it and put some pressure on me.

As for the current project which is long overdue, I have some free time this week so I hope to put it out by the end of it. just have to film one last scene, do some effect work with After Effects and cut the first half a bit tighter, all that should be doable this week.
