Yes, I have an idea and a title already and it\u2019s something I\u2019m quite enthusiastic about. I will go into details of what this project is about in another blog entry, for now, I just have to announce it and put some pressure on myself.<\/p><p>As for the current project which is long overdue, I have some free time this week so I hope to put it out by the end of it. just have to film one last scene, do some effect work with After Effects and cut the first half a bit tighter, all that should be doable this week.<\/p>"},"id":"18a0e209-7d71-43fb-a7e2-f1537dcaad6a","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
