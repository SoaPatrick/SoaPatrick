What a process this was, but I finally found the time to finish it and man oh man am I glad it's finally **out there**. It all started in [August](https://www.soapatrick.com/2019/08/progress-on-cursor/) when I shot the first footage, I started a few times in the meantime and the idea of what is now in the final version is something that evolved over the past **two months**.

I could go into great detail about why it took so long and what I learned doing this short little movie but for now, I just want to put it out there. The retrospective process I will spare for another blog post. In the meantime, **enjoy!**
