Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>It\u2019s funny that something from Google (yes Youtube belongs to Google, in case you didn\u2019t know) slows down the page that dramatically and the <strong>Google Page Speed<\/strong> results take a dive because of it. I realized since I started paying close attention, that if you embed <strong>Youtube videos<\/strong>, either through WordPress or through the embedded code from Youtube itself, a ton of stuff gets loaded even though you may not play the video. That\u2019s not very <strong>optimized<\/strong> I\u2019d say.<\/p><p>So what can be done? The logical conclusion is to download everything youtube related only when the user actually clicks on the video. Until then only a preview image or placeholder image gets loaded.<\/p><p>There are a few <strong>plugins<\/strong> that do this sort of thing for WordPress but then again you install another plugin and the list of installed plugins gets longer and longer. Or you find some tutorials on how to do it yourself. It\u2019s actually not that complicated, you write a <strong>PHP function<\/strong> to replace all youtube embedded iFrames with your own markup and with <strong>Javascript<\/strong> you load the preview Image from that specific Youtube video in the newly created markup. Once the user clicks on the Play button, the image gets replaced with the actual embedded Code and the video starts playing.<\/p><p>It\u2019s now implemented here on SoaPatrick and apart from certain videos that don\u2019t get replaced (have to invest some time to find out what\u2019s wrong there) it seems to work fine, the page speed is as high as before and I\u2019m happy. It\u2019s just a pain that Youtube\u2019s default behavior isn\u2019t already doing that.<\/p>"},"id":"8e56f0b9-8fce-454a-af84-3b49db0d333f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
