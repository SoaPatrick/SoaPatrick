I recently also took a short trip to the beautiful french city **Colmar**, the weather was changing constantly between light rain and sunshine. Nonetheless, I took my camera with me and tried taking beautiful shots once again.

Some of them turned out quite nice with the reflection in the water or with the sky being cloudy. I missed some better opportunities but I'm happy with what I shot that day.
