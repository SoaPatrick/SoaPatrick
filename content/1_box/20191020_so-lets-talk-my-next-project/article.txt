Old: At the beginning of this month, I talked about a new Project and even [revealed](https://www.soapatrick.com/2019/10/how-long-do-we-have/) the title but there were no details about anything else. Well, now I spill the beans on this project.

Actually the idea is not even mine but a task in a [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-sBvBBi6MY) from D4Darius. In this video, he lists 30 tasks for 30 days, some sort of crash course for filmmakers which he compressed based on a 3-year film school curriculum. One of these tasks it's about a dialogue scene.

> A: Hey  
> **B: How long do we have?**  
> A: All night  
> **B: Ok**

Now I loved the idea of taking a very simple dialogue and film that in different ways with different meanings. I did take some liberties to change something. I reduced it to just a question: "How long do we have" and an answer which changes in each version.

The cool thing about this is the **endless** possibilities to put that question in a different meaning and the fact that I can make even shorter, **self-contained** movies and play around with different styles and genres.

So the next step is to **write** down ideas and then shoot them once an idea is fleshed out. The plan is to bundle some of them together and release a video with a few versions and if there are so many ideas I might make a Volume 1 and then further down the road a Volume 2 and so on. But I try not to get ahead of myself, let's just start with a few short ones.
