Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>At the beginning of this month, I talked about a new Project and even <a href=\"\/box\/how-long-do-we-have\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">revealed<\/a> the title but there were no details about anything else. Well, now I spill the beans on this project.<\/p><p>Actually, the idea is not even mine but a task in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1-sBvBBi6MY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Video<\/a> from D4Darius. In this video, he lists 30 tasks for 30 days, some sort of crash course for filmmakers which he compressed based on a 3-year film school curriculum. One of these tasks it\u2019s about a dialogue scene.<\/p>"},"id":"25774883-9433-4779-b5ed-b001c4ac42c9","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<p>A: Hey<br><strong>B: How long do we have?<\/strong><br>A: All night<br><strong>B: Ok<\/strong><\/p>","citation":"","style":"default"},"id":"a20ce2a3-465d-46c3-870c-139aba079eae","isHidden":false,"type":"quote"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Now I loved the idea of taking a very simple dialogue and film that \nin different ways with different meanings. I did take some liberties to \nchange something. I reduced it to just a question: \u201cHow long do we have\u201d\n and an answer which changes in each version.<\/p> <p>The cool thing about this is the <strong>endless<\/strong> possibilities to put that question in a different meaning and the fact that I can make even shorter, <strong>self-contained<\/strong> movies and play around with different styles and genres.<\/p> <p>So the next step is to <strong>write<\/strong> down ideas and then \nshoot them once an idea is fleshed out. The plan is to bundle some of \nthem together and release a video with a few versions and if there are \nso many ideas I might make a Volume 1 and then further down the road a \nVolume 2 and so on.  But I try not to get ahead of myself, let\u2019s just \nstart with a few short ones.<\/p>"},"id":"864715db-4c60-46ea-8324-6af35cb7afcf","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
