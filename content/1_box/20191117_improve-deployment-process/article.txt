After that <a href=\"https:\/\/buddy.works\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buddy.Works<\/a> checks my repository and updates the theme on every push.<\/p><p>Now since all styling changes are made through my <code>SCSS<\/code> files I used to commit the compiled <code>CSS<\/code> file as well which, let\u2019s be honest, was never really ideal. So for a new project, I took a closer look at Buddy.Works and read tons of tutorials. With <code>Node.js<\/code> and a <code>Gulp<\/code> task I was able to compile SCSS files within the building and deploying process and I can finally stop committing compiled CSS files.<\/p>"},"id":"8e700b3d-d957-40bb-87fb-2836beeb3cc0","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
