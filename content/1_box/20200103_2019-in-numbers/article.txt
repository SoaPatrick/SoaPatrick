Old: I'm a statistic nut and it's always fun to check some numbers from the past year. So I collected some infos on various topics:

- I wrote **48 Blog Post Entries** (9'317 words)
- I shot **3 Short Movies** (6 minutes total runtime)
- I posted **22 Fotos** on Instagram
- I watched **105 Movies**
- I watched **575+ TV Episodes**

If I look at these numbers and if I have any new years resolutions for 2020 it would to be increase the numbers for the first three, especially since those numbers were bigger in 2018 (**139** Blog Posts and **59** Fotos on Instagram for example).

Oh and by the way, I wrote **333** Blog Posts and **82'820** Words in the last Century, not bad.
