Old: I don’t want to make some top 10 lists about stuff I liked and didn’t like the past year as I did for 2017 ([Best Movies](https://www.soapatrick.com/2017/12/the-best-movies-of-2017/), [Worst Movies](https://www.soapatrick.com/2017/12/the-worst-movies-of-2017/), [Best TV Shows](https://www.soapatrick.com/2017/12/the-best-tv-shows-of-2017/)). Or just [look ahead](https://www.soapatrick.com/2019/01/why-not-a-look-ahead/) like I did last year. No, this year I thought I just mention things that I liked, things that I didn’t like and also some stuff that I did that’s worth mentioning. Everything sorted alphabetically.

## Things I liked

- **Avengers: Endgame**, a movie Event that will never be reproduced, ever, and I witness the whole shabang live in theatres.
- **Barry**, A TV Show that really surprised me on so many levels.
- **Bocksmart**, probably the sweetest teenager movie in a while.
- **Buffy The Vampire Slayer**, rewatching one of my favorite TV Show for the hundredth time
- **Game of Thrones**, The Long Night from, let's just say my most intense TV hour of the week (apart from rewatching [The Body](https://www.soapatrick.com/2019/10/what-the-body-means-to-me/))
- **Midsommar**, Another exceptional Horror movie from Ari Aster, he’s a talent to look out for
- **Mindhunters**, watching David Fincher construct scenes is just mesmerizing, people talking can be so intense and interesting.
- **Orange is the new Black**: an emotional and a very satisfying ending.
- **Peanut Butter Falcon**, Shia is just a mesmerizing actor to watch and the movie is so sweet without ever being corny.
- **Rick and Morty**, for a long time I avoided it, but now I can't get enough, fucking hilarious.
- The **Sazorac**, my new favorite cocktail, if done right, and at home, it's always done right!
- **Stranger Things**, it keeps its quality high even with season 3.
- **Tool**, a new Album after 13 years, not their best but who cares, it's fucking TOOL.
- **Toy Story 4**, A very emotional and damn fine ending to Woody’s arch.
- **Tschernobyl**, The best 6 Hours on TV this year, I keep telling everyone to watch it.
- **Unbelievable**, a nice surprise of a crime show with very good leads, I was hooked.

## Things I didn’t like

- **6 Underground**, Michael Bay in overdrive and unchecked. I was bored after 5 minutes.
- **Dark Phoenix**, giving Simon Kinberg all these X-Men Movies to play with wasn't a good idea.
- **Game of Thrones**, Yes it's on both lists. That ending, man oh man.
- **Glas**, he should have stopped after Unbreakable, this one was not necessary.
- **Hellboy**, another unnecessary sequel/reboot.
- **MIB International**, Aaaaand another one, they just keep on making crappy sequel/reboots.
- **Star Wars Rise of the Skywalkers**, yap a Star Wars movie is on this list, what a huge disappointment this movie was.

## What else did I do?

- Learned working more extensively with **Git**
- got heavily into **automation** of workflows
- started to play around with **Rest API**
- Worked and tinkered too much on **SoaPatrickSix**
- Thought too much about **making movies** (instead of doing it)
- Stopped walking through every street in Basel
- Oh and yeah, I turned 40 this year
