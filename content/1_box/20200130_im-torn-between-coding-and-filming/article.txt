Because during the last year I learned a lot about Webdesign, Online Marketing, WordPress and a lot of frontend-related things. And somehow I\u2019d love to include all that knowledge into this place here, meaning optimize the hell out of SoaPatrick.<\/p><p>I\u2019d love to rewrite the whole page with a much more organized <code>SASS<\/code> structure, use <code>CSS Grid<\/code> whenever possible and use more <code>mixins<\/code> and <code>functions<\/code> and play around with <code>SASS Maps<\/code>.<\/p><p>Then I\u2019d love to clean up the PHP structure because it\u2019s a mess. Kick out stuff I don\u2019t need and really trim the fat of the theme, make it blazing fast.<\/p><p>I\u2019d love to play around with <code>AJAX<\/code> or load stuff through <code>REST API<\/code> and maybe work a bit with <code>Vue.js<\/code>. Yes, I\u2019ve even played around with the idea of going headless (JAMstack sounds very cool) but that might be a bit much for now.<\/p><p>But all this would keep me from actually making short films because I cannot get better, faster and more efficient without actually doing the work. But after a long day of doing all the frontend stuff at work, I love to work some more on this place right here, put the stuff I learned to good use here as well. It all feels so easy and natural and it just flows and you see results right away.<\/p><p>Compare that to making movies, it\u2019s hard to come up with ideas, find the time to film something, edit it together, record sounds effects, mix it, add color corrections and then after a million small changes actually render it and see another small thing you\u2019d like to fix.<\/p><p>But I love the filming aspect of it so much, the rest is something I need to get better at. And I know that I\u2019m making a lot of excuses but the funny thing is that I don\u2019t make these excuses when it comes to coding stuff.<\/p><p>So like I said I\u2019m torn, and with the little time I have every evening I find it hard to do both. These words might turn out to be a bit confusing and are all over the place, but maybe it\u2019s good to actually write them down. Maybe something productive will come out of it.<\/p>"},"id":"f3877119-b9ea-48d0-9629-47d22c9eabc2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
