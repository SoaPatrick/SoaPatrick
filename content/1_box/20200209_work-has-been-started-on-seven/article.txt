Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I took a long walk today through Basel and actually continued with my New Years\u2019 resolution from <a href=\"\/box\/why-not-a-look-ahead\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2019<\/a>. And during that walk, I thought of all the things I want to improve upon with the new version and when I arrived at home, I created a new repository, cloned my starter theme and made my first commits.<\/p><p>I also decided to use <code>git-flow<\/code>, might as well try it now, might be useful in the near future. I\u2019m kinda pumped about where it all leads.<\/p><p>But just to clarify, the idea with version seven is to recreate this exact theme here but with a much more improved structure under the hood, there are no plans for a redesign. But I know myself, I will code a few things differently and in the end, it might look different, I don\u2019t know where the road to Seven will lead.<\/p>"},"id":"d306b8f2-0619-4919-9051-322c0a1c70ad","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
