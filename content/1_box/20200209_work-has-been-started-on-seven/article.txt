Old: I took a long walk today through Basel and actually continuing with my New Years' resolution from [2019](https://www.soapatrick.com/2019/01/why-not-a-look-ahead/). And during that walk, I thought of all the things I want to improve upon with the new version and when I arrived at home, I created a new repository, cloned my starter theme and made my first commits.

I also decided to use `git-flow`, might as well try it now, might be useful in the near future. I'm kinda pumped about where it all leads.

But just to clarify, the idea with version seven is to recreate this exact theme here but with a much more improved structure under the hood, there are no plans for a redesign. But I know myself, I will code a few things differently and in the end it might look different, I don't know where the road to Seven will lead.
