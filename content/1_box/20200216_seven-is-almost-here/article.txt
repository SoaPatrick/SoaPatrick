Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I had a busy coding weekend where I recreated the current theme but used everything I\u2019ve learned in the last 12 months. There was a lot of code I could rewrite more efficiently or code which was not needed at all anymore but was just laying around.<\/p><p>I would have released it this weekend already, but there are some pages that need some work first. The Archive view, The Factory view and some <code>PHP<\/code> functions to run everything smoothly. I guess by the end of next week I will release it.<\/p><p>Another thing, I took a break today from all the coding to go out and get some fresh air and enjoy the nice warm weather. During that time I kept thinking of things to write, and with write, I mean <code>PHP<\/code>, <code>HTML<\/code>, <code>JS<\/code> or <code>SASS<\/code>. I mean I do this all week at work and then on a weekend I keep doing the same things and while I\u2019m outside I think about it as well. Isn\u2019t that crazy? And while I walked and thought about my WordPress Theme, I realized that I have to get to that point with making movies. Be so involved with it that I keep thinking about it every free minute.<\/p><p>Just some thoughts before I try to enjoy the last few minutes of the weekend not doing anything website-related.<\/p>"},"id":"51a82a79-c762-418a-b616-c62f5e76a481","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
