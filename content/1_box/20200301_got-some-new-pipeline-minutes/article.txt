Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>A new month and it all starts back at zero. So I used my Sunday with working on version <strong>2.3.0<\/strong>. The biggest new addition to the theme or the page, in general, is a <a href=\"\/privacy-policy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Data Protection<\/a> page where I go into some detail about what is happening with your data on this website. The short answer? I don\u2019t collect your data, but I thought I could explain and be transparent about it. The page can always be accessed through the nice little icon in the footer.<\/p><p>I also improved the list view of related blog posts in the factory detail view. and added colorized code styling back again. Makes reading the code much easier.<\/p><p>As for the next release, I will probably rethink the grid with better grid column widths. After that, I can define new image sizes and reduce the number of breakpoints. But from a technical standpoint, those are the remaining big ones.<\/p><p>From a content standpoint, I plan on writing excerpts for all the factory items, because this makes sense from a sharing and SEO perspective. But I do also have an idea for a new short, but that\u2019s something for another blog post.<\/p>"},"id":"dc55ea81-b8ea-4030-a05d-fe5c9d3f5ebd","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
