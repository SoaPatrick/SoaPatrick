It was an interesting project, creating such a big website with WordPress was a big learning experience. A lot of things I learned and discovered flew into SoaPatrickSeven.<\/p><p>One of the things that I adapted here is the theme and template structure, a more lean and logical structure of all the files in the theme. This structure makes it easier for other people to find things if they have to make changes to a theme. I know this isn\u2019t relevant with <strong>SoaPatrick<\/strong> but it\u2019s helpful anyway.<\/p><p>Then I also got rid of all the <strong>Gutenberg<\/strong> styling and used my own, that way I could leave out all the styling for blocks I didn\u2019t use, which is a lot.<\/p><p>There are still some things in the backlog, actually the same tasks as in my last <a href=\"\/box\/got-some-new-pipeline-minutes\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post<\/a> and hopefully, I get to that sooner than later, the same with my next movie project.<\/p>"},"id":"844a8437-9ed3-448c-89b4-e3ea29d6acd3","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
