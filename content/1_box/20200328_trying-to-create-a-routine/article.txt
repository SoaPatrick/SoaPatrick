Old: With the upcoming work situation changing for the unforeseeable future, I thought it would be a good time to get back into some routines. So starting with tomorrow I think I will do the following:

- start the day with 20-30 minutes riding the bike
- do my fitness routine every second day, at least 3 times a week
- try to write a daily blog entry, get the ball going again.
- define days on which I work on a project and mark them in a calendar

Hopefully, with a structured day, I will be productive over the next few weeks and then some cool things will come out of it. So let's find out.
