Now\n with that release, I will change the Image sizes and then regenerate \nall 480 images again, and delete unused ones. Now when I tested that \nlocally all Blog posts or factory items didn\u2019t display the images \nanymore, which means I have to go through all posts and fix the broken \nlinks. It\u2019s a pain to do that but I noticed that over the years by \ncreating new image sizes and regenerating over and over again, certain \nimages have over 20 different image sizes. Now, these take up a lot of \nspace and with version 2.5 I will work with only 3 sizes. So this will \nfree up some disk space and make things more organized again.<\/p> <p>The reason I write this is because, during that time hardly any \nimages are being displayed until I fix that, it\u2019s just a heads up.<\/p>"},"id":"7ca9728e-82ce-4a55-9357-b7711108d0d2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
