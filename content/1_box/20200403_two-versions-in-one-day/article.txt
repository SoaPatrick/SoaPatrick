Old: Well, that's unusual but I thought what the hell. But let me explain. Like I mentioned on (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2020/04/wordpress-5-4-and-sp7-2-5/ text: Wednesdays target: _blank) post today I released SP 2.5 with some changes under the hood (all that can be found at the (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/log/ text: log target: _blank) btw):

- **Removed** all Gutenberg color options
- **Changed** Youtube play buttons styling
- **Changed** image sizes for generated images
- **Changed** CSS grid for the whole website
- **Added** SCSS variables for breakpoints
- **Added** better code block styling
- **Added** excerpt field to factory items

As for the SCSS Variables, instead of using one of these approaches from (link: https://css-tricks.com/approaches-media-queries-sass/ text: css-tricks.com target: _blank), I simply created some variables:

```sass
$breakpoint__370--max: (max-width: 370px);
$breakpoint__371--min: (min-width: 371px);
$breakpoint__767--max: (max-width: 767px);
$breakpoint__768--min: (min-width: 768px);
$breakpoint__991--max: (max-width: 991px);
$breakpoint__992--min: (min-width: 992px);
$breakpoint__1199--max: (max-width: 1199px);
$breakpoint__1200--min: (min-width: 1200px);
$breakpoint__1499--max: (max-width: 1499px);
$breakpoint__1500--min: (min-width: 1500px);
```

So I was all said and done (except for regenerating and then reincluding all images, that still need to be done) when I had the idea to include the language visually to the code block.

The only reason I included those Variables above was to showcase that. So I sat down, looked at the plugin and wrote a small script which adds the language in its own div so I can style it:

```javascript
// Add language to all Code Blocks
var allCodeBlocks = document.querySelectorAll(".wp-block-code");
for (var i = 0; i < allCodeBlocks.length; i++) {
	var singleCodeBlock = allCodeBlocks[i].children;
	for (var j = 0; j < singleCodeBlock.length; j++) {
		if (singleCodeBlock[j].hasAttribute("lang")) {
			var codeLang = singleCodeBlock[j].getAttribute("lang");
		}
	}
	allCodeBlocks[i].insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', '<div class="prism-language">'+ codeLang +'</div>');
}
```

So I created a new Epic with a new release number and added that as well. So there you go, enjoy the small changes, I'm off for now before I have to go through all posts again where Images are included, ufff.
