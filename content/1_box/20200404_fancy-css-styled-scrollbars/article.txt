Old: I don't know why I didn't think of that earlier, but what this place definitely was missing, is colorized fancy scrollbars!

So I made a new update today (in which I also fixed the page title for the Factory page) and now the scrollbar changes with the color theme as well.

```css
/* Scrollbar */
::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 8px;
  height: 8px;
}

/* Track */
::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  background: transparent;
}

/* Handle */
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: var(--color__highlight);
}
```

Now the scrollbar styling works for horizontal and vertical scrolling in **Chrome** and **Safari**, unfortunately not in Firefox and Microsoft Edge. The Edge thing is kinda strange because the latest Edge Browser uses Chromium engine, oh well.

As for IE11, well I will have some interesting news to that tomorrow.
