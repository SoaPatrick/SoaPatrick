Old: The first short film is still in the planning stage but I ended up using Blender to recreate my Office so I could plan shots. I was using Blender a lot longer than I wanted to but I realized that my Mac Mini IS capable of some stuff.

I learned a few new tricks with these pictures and for an afternoons work, they look decent.

The plan is to create some storyboards and use Blender and the ability to move around freely for new possible compositions. But it's always funny that a small idea turns into a short movie with 30 or so different shots. Sometimes I just want to make a short movie with 5 or so shots.
