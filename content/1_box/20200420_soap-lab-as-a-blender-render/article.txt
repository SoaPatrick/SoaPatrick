Old: I've been glued to the screen the last few days, trying new things with blender and running my Mac Mini into overdrive. This new rendition of my (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/factory/soap-lab/ text: Soap Lab Logo target: _blank) was a bit tricky on the rendering side because of the glass.

Rendering glass without much noise needs a lot of render samples and that slows everything down. Using the denoiser didn't deliver a better result either, so I ended up using no denoiser in Blender and instead used denoise in Photoshop where I had much more control over it.

I like the finished result. I wanted to add some text to the glass but many failed attempts made me realize that's for some other time, now I take what I can and move on to the next small project, and the idea list is growing each day.
