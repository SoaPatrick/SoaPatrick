Pepper created in Blender

I've created a blender version of something I truly hate but it was good practice to test out some stuff. I actually tried to make an animation where dozens of peppers are rolling down the street, but after using 20 my Mac Mini wasn't responding anymore.

I've noticed that as soon as I play around with animation and a few objects, my Mac is not playing nice anymore, so I guess I focus on still images instead for the time being.
