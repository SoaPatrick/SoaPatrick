I've started with some character design and I thought Bender from Futurama might be the easiest one because of his shape, but still had some difficulties getting it right. I also spend a lot of time fixing some beginner mistakes I made early on, but I'm learning new things every day and I apply what I've learned instantly and improved current projects. There a lot more projects currently on my list, so I keep them coming.
