Old: On Sunday it was day two of principal photography for the next short film Home Office. It was actually rather reshooting things from day one after watching a rough cut. Some scenes got a much better composition and I think the lighting was improved as well. Upon doing a rough cut again, I once again noticed 2 scenes I need to reshoot because they were slightly out of focus. I really need to check the footage much more careful in the future because setting everything up again takes a lot of time.

The plan would be to shoot the rest soon but now something came in between. Right after shooting on Sunday, a new idea came up which would be perfect for a one-minute short film as an entry for a contest. The plan is to shoot that one this long weekend and hopefully have it ready to submit it by May 7th. I will go into more detail in an upcoming blog post.
