Maybe I will go into more detail on how everything came together \nwith some images of the different stages of the whole scene in Blender. \nBut now my eyes hurt and I need to see and hear something else besides \ncar rushing past me.<\/p>"},"id":"63db9f5f-54af-401c-aa3c-2605ed756326","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
