But since I did so much in the last month I thought I\u2019d go through it again, you know, just so that I can see everything I\u2019ve accomplished. By the way, the photograph has no correlation to today\u2019s post, I just thought Grissu looks kinda sweet.<\/p>"},"id":"b484c6f6-cd17-4711-9b08-be6992ca95fc","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"SoaPatrickSeven"},"id":"44287144-7c9a-45d0-bc0b-11d000082b8b","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I know I\u2019ve released <a href=\"\/factory\/soapatrickseven\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SP7<\/a> in march but so many additional features were added during the first part of April, in fact, there is nothing left for me to work on which feels really nice. It finally gave me time to focus on other stuff. A complete list of changes can, of course, be found in the <a href=\"\/log\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">log<\/a>.<\/p><p>There are still sometimes ideas in my head to keep adding new stuff or making a complete overhaul of the website, but frankly, I\u2019m thankful my mind is focused on other stuff, finally!<\/p>"},"id":"0947d030-81b6-452d-9a3a-cf1e40e3432a","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Blender"},"id":"b68a623b-55d6-4449-bb9d-5e003c178f1e","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Who knew this special situation would lead me to start working with Blender again. I know that initially, I thought my mac wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it but it turns out I had to understand Blender a bit better again and realized what I have to tweak to make it work. It still takes a lot of time to render images and even longer to render animations, but there is a plan in place to change that in the future.<\/p><p>I\u2019ve started with simple shapes, like my <a href=\"\/box\/home-office-with-blender\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">office<\/a> then went on to create, or start, my whole <a href=\"\/box\/my-apartment-in-blender\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">apartment<\/a> in miniature form. From that, I went on to more complex ones like <a href=\"\/box\/soap-lab-as-a-blender-render\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">glass<\/a> and <a href=\"\/box\/no-blender-animations-for-now\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pepperoni<\/a> (or pepper or whatever people call it), created a <a href=\"\/box\/here-have-a-goody\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">goody<\/a> for a side project, and ended up doing my own version of <a href=\"\/box\/bender-in-blender\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bender<\/a> in 3D. I also started to play around with camera tracking and adding models into real live footage and animating them there. This is where the render time blew up and where I can\u2019t wait for a proper Blender machine.<\/p>"},"id":"cb81c9dc-314c-4a15-a6d3-1f4f52279680","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"align":"default","location":"kirby","video":["blender-animation_bender-balcony.mp4"],"url":"","caption":""},"id":"0c997ebe-cf29-443a-b855-1a86ae5c7a58","isHidden":false,"type":"video"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I\u2019m so invested in Blender it\u2019s crazy, I keep being glued to the monitor and always try to improve my images and learn new stuff, hopefully, this keeps going.

I\u2019m not sure if all of them will ever see the light of day but it was important for me to pick up the camera again, play around with it and see what\u2019s possible. But I realized once again that being behind the camera, choosing angles and compositions is the thing I love, and being in front of the camera and \u2018acting\u2019, prevents me from successfully doing that in an efficient way.

I mean I could just lean back and watch TV all the time but I wanted to do stuff with all my free time and I think looking back at the last 30 days, I really did that. Now I look forward to the next 30 days and what funky stuff I will produce in that time frame.<\/p>"},"id":"2a94befa-a776-4dd0-8257-f46491315665","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
