In April I had this idea to create my whole apartment in Blender, and render it in miniature form. But, I will add enough details to the objects so that I can render close up shots as well any maybe use my digitized apartment in some form for movies.

For quite some time I tried to create that lamp I'm having above my bar and today I finally figured out how to model it. I'm quite happy with the result so I created this moody shot of my bar.

I made a new render with better light bulbs, much better this way.
