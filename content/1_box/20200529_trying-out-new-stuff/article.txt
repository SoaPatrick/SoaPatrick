Old: The cool thing about having my living-room build in Blender is that it allows me to play around with certain ideas. What if I want to buy a new and bigger TV? How will it look, will it fit? What if I want to rearrange the living room and make room for something else but the cat tree needs to find a new place.

Or how about having my living-room out in the open, getting some sun while watching TV? The possibilities are endless and it was fun to play around with that.

The truth is that I'd love to move over to more complex stuff but for one, adding more details to my apartment in Blender is fun and second my mac cannot handle more complex stuff, more complex stuff needs a powerful graphics card which my mac doesn't have.

But I've got some news on that front. I've prepared my second workspace in my office (should start to work on my office in Blender actually, some interesting things could be done there) and I plan on buying and building (yes building it as well) my first gaming PC. I've watched hours of video content on YouTube about all the components so that I can make good decisions about what to buy.

So I've got some free time at the end of June and the beginning of July and that's the time I plan on building my gaming PC. It will be interesting, especially working on Windows.
