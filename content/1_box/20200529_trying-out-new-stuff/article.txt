Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>The cool thing about having my living-room build in Blender is that \nit allows me to play around with certain ideas. What if I want to buy a \nnew and bigger TV? How will it look, will it fit? What if I want to \nrearrange the living room and make room for something else but the cat \ntree needs to find a new place.<\/p> <p>Or how about having my living-room out in the open, getting some sun \nwhile watching TV? The possibilities are endless and it was fun to play \naround with that.<\/p>"},"id":"68c50340-6df9-4072-a45b-a58ec1f4ccbc","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"columns":2,"lightbox":"true","align":"default","images":["apartment_11.jpg","apartment_12.jpg","apartment_13.jpg"]},"id":"d7b2c169-d251-4230-943d-909d777c4399","isHidden":false,"type":"gallery"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The truth is that I\u2019d love to move over to more complex stuff but for\n one, adding more details to my apartment in Blender is fun and second \nmy mac cannot handle more complex stuff, more complex stuff needs a \npowerful graphics card which my mac doesn\u2019t have.<\/p> <p>But I\u2019ve got some news on that front. I\u2019ve prepared my second \nworkspace in my office (should start to work on my office in Blender \nactually, some interesting things could be done there) and I plan on \nbuying and building (yes building it as well) my first gaming PC. I\u2019ve \nwatched hours of video content on YouTube about all the components so \nthat I can make good decisions about what to buy.<\/p> <p>So I\u2019ve got some free time at the end of June and the beginning of \nJuly and that\u2019s the time I plan on building my gaming PC. It will be \ninteresting, especially working on Windows.<\/p>"},"id":"b8f61c52-3c33-4308-b858-5da16b5f9ad9","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
