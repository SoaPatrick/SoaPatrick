So I thought this could be an interesting series where I \ndiscuss the decision behind all the elements of the PC and why I did \ndecide to buy this specific version.<\/p> <p>So to start it all of let\u2019s begin with the case, the part that will \nhouse all other parts. The main concern for me when I had to decide what\n kind of PC case I want to buy was airflow. I want to make sure all \ncomponents will stay cool and not overheat and maybe even get damaged. \nSo a case with a mesh front made the most sense. As for the size, \nsomething in the middle seemed logical, enough room for all the parts \nbut not too big since I won\u2019t build a monster of a PC.<\/p> <p>After many different cases I looked at and compared with each other I decided to go with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bequiet.com\/de\/case\/1854\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">be quiet!

The mesh front will make sure, \nenough cool air will get sucked inside and the case comes with 3 fans \nalready installed. I might replace those stock fans with better ones \ndown the road, but I first I need to see how those perform.<\/p> <p>So that\u2019s the case, next I will discuss the motherboard.<\/p>"},"id":"3b053db5-b8a4-4f89-9d54-c92889b07138","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
