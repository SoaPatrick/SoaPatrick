Old: I was thinking some time about how much RAM I should buy and in what configuration. Should I opt for two or four modules of 64GB DDR4 DRAM. In one case I cannot upgrade without buying everything new again. In the end, it was a long-term decision, buy only two modules now so that I can expand in the future with two additional modules to a whopping 128GB.

After some looking around for RAM modules, I decided to go with Corsair, of the non-RGB variety, and with 3200MHz. They will be hidden behind the CPU Cooler anyway, so no need for flashy RGB Colors.
