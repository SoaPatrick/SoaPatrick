I\u2019m using a Ultra Wide Monitor \nfor PC so if I want play some games I need enough power for all those \npixels and I\u2019d like to have a fast enough GPU for Blender to quickly \nrender those images and videos.<\/p> <p>Look I don\u2019t want to stretch it out any further, so let\u2019s make this \nquick. I wanted an NVidia because Blender actually utilizes NVidia cards\n a lot better than ones from AMD. The RTX 2070S seemed to be the sweet \nspot when it comes to price and power so that made the most sense \nbecause an RTX 2080Ti was just WAY to expensive and the RTX 2080S wasn\u2019t\n worth the extra money which what performance I would gain. So, in the \nend, I went with an ASUS card because, you know, quality.<\/p> <p>On a side not, all my components are finally together, so technically\n I could start building my PC right now, but it\u2019s something I don\u2019t want\n to hurry, I want to make it right and have a functional PC in the end, \nbut weekend is coming up, so we\u2019ll see what happens then.<\/p>"},"id":"c6d1b8b3-aa2b-4f47-be9e-6146f9f5a744","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
