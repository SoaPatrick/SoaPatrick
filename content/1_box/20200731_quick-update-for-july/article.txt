Old: I need to get that blog post published in July or I won't have an archive entry for July 2020. There was actually a blog post planned for almost a month now but something kept me from writing here.

Yes I've build my PC and for the last 4 weeks, a game has gotten my full attention. I've been playing Red Dead Redemption 2 almost constantly and I'm having a blast playing it. The endless possibility of an open world game is amazing. The downside is that the PC hasn't really been used for anything else, like Blender, but I will get to that, I know that.

So I hope that I can get back to writing and producing content again after I've played RDR2 through of course. So if you excuse me, some missions are waiting for me.
