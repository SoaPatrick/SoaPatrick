Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I need to get that blog post published in July or I won\u2019t have an archive entry for July 2020. There was actually a blog post planned for almost a month now but something kept me from writing here.<\/p><p>Yes, I\u2019ve built my PC and for the last 4 weeks, a game has gotten my full attention. I\u2019ve been playing Red Dead Redemption 2 almost constantly and I\u2019m having a blast playing it. The endless possibility of an open-world game is amazing. The downside is that the PC hasn\u2019t really been used for anything else, like Blender, but I will get to that, I know that.<\/p><p>So I hope that I can get back to writing and producing content again after I\u2019ve played RDR2 through of course. So if you excuse me, some missions are waiting for me.<\/p>"},"id":"800b4380-bc25-40f8-9957-851356249ec3","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
