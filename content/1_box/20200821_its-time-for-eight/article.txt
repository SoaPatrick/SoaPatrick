Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I\u2019m slowly crunching out of my game-cave and while doing that I realized that I need a new project. I haven\u2019t done much else besides gaming since the beginning of July and in order for that to change significantly, I need something new to focus on. So I thought a few days about this and It\u2019s time for a new design.<\/p><p>I know that with <a href=\"\/factory\/soapatrickfive\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SP5<\/a>, <a href=\"\/factory\/soapatricksix\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SP6<\/a> and <a href=\"\/factory\/soapatrickseven\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SP7<\/a> it was more of incremental design changes and with SP8 I want to start from scratch. Ditch the old design(s) and create something completely different.<\/p><p>I have some ideas and some things I\u2019d love to keep having on SP8, like the ability to customize the color theme maybe and the light\/dark mode. I also want to include Blender Renderings into the design, maybe that will nudge me slightly to go back to Blender. Then I improved my gulp script with a watch task recently and that\u2019s something I\u2019d like to improve upon with SP8 as well. The idea is to completely avoid using <a href=\"https:\/\/codekitapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CodeKit<\/a>, even though I love it. But I think to get more mature with my coding and development skills I need to get serious about <a href=\"https:\/\/gulpjs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gulp.js<\/a> automation.<\/p><p>So the next step would be to create a new repository and start a brand new theme, a clean slate, and then see where it all leads. I look forward to it but don\u2019t expect results for some time.<\/p>"},"id":"6098b050-81a6-45a0-b913-1febb24d4b31","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
