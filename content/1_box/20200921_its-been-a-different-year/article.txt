Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I think we can all agree that the year 2020 (and maybe even part of \n2021) will be remembered as a very different year, one that might change\n how we as a society function, but it\u2019s also a very different year for \neach one of us personally.<\/p> <p>At the beginning of the corona outbreak, I knew that with me working \nnot that much I could use the newly found free time to get better at \nsomething. I used that time intensely to create a lot of Blender \nrenderings and it was so fulfilling that I decided to buy myself a PC \nwhich much more horsepower. That PC has so far mostly been used to play \nRDR2 (which I enjoyed immensely) and less for creating things.<\/p> <p>I\u2019ve also been really tired lately, I think this special time has \ntaken a toll on me or I really need a break from work badly. Yes, work, \nwork has been difficult lately and it\u2019s a topic I don\u2019t want to get into\n but let\u2019s just say getting up in the morning for work has sometimes \nbeen a real drag. But maybe a well-deserved break in October might bring\n some positive change and recharging my batteries is always a good \nthing.<\/p> <p>So what\u2019s the point of this blog post? Well, I think I just wanted to\n speak my mind a bit, therefore it might be a bit of a chaotic read, I \ndon\u2019t know.<\/p> <p>I had some big plans a few weeks ago and it just feels sometimes like\n I\u2019m having reached a dead end. I don\u2019t do that much creative stuff and \nsometimes play hours of RDR2. Maybe the game just delivers the much need\n escapism I sometimes need.<\/p> <p>The one creative thing I\u2019ve been working on lately was \nSoaPatrickEight which started as a quite promising new idea and then \ndecided to stick with incremental updates to my SoaPatrick themes.<\/p>"},"id":"94e465b3-0197-4f2a-9d6e-3c5a43e2d7d1","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["sp8-beta.png"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"true","ratio":"","crop":"false","align":"default"},"id":"9012e6d6-b53b-4f8e-b6bb-bb385432103e","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>This is a rough version of the idea I had for <strong>SoaPatrickEight<\/strong>, and I still might end up with that version someday but for now, SoaPatrickEight will look similar to <a href=\"\/factory\/soapatrickseven\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SoaPatrickSeven<\/a> with some smaller changes based on ideas I had for SoaPatrickEight. I think I just didn\u2019t have the will, energy, and time to make a bigger structural change to my site because what is visible now is the result of an idea that started two and a half years ago with <a href=\"\/factory\/soapatrickfive\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SoaPatrickFive<\/a>. I\u2019ve been perfecting that theme ever since, so changing everything is kinda like looking up a huge mountain and realizing what a steep and long climb that will be and I\u2019m too tired for that right now.<\/p><p>I know I sound really depressed but I\u2019m just tired (will be going to bed right after I publish this) and there\u2019s no need for me to worry, just speaking my mind.<\/p><p>So what\u2019s the takeaway from today\u2019s post? I think writing a lot more again might be therapeutical, it once put me back on track and helped me get more creative, so maybe I have to put out my thoughts and hit the keyboard a lot more often.<\/p><p>Please don\u2019t judge this post too harshly, I\u2019m not sure it all made sense and I\u2019m sure there are some grammatically weird sentences and I\u2019m not even going to go through the text again to find them, so if you find some you can keep them. Me? I\u2019m off to bed now, see you tomorrow.<\/p>"},"id":"0a6da8a0-5506-4ba7-a435-c9f61b0babe3","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
