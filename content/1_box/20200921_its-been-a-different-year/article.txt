Old: I think we can all agree that the year 2020 (and maybe even part of 2021) will be remembered as a very different year, one that might change how we as a society function, but it’s also a very different year for each one of us personally.

At the beginning of the corona outbreak, I knew that with me working not that much I could use the newly found free time to get better at something. I used that time intensely to create a lot of Blender renderings and it was so fulfilling that I decided to buy myself a PC which much more horsepower. That PC has so far mostly been used to play RDR2 (which I enjoyed immensely) and less for creating things.

I’ve also been really tired lately, I think this special time has taken a toll on me or I really need a break from work badly. Yes, work, work has been difficult lately and it’s a topic I don’t want to get into but let’s just say getting up in the morning for work has sometimes been a real drag. But maybe a well-deserved break in October might bring some positive change and recharging my batteries is always a good thing.

So what’s the point of this blog post? Well, I think I just wanted to speak my mind a bit, therefore it might be a bit of a chaotic read, I don’t know.

I had some big plans a few weeks ago and it just feels sometimes like I’m having reached a dead end. I don’t do that much creative stuff and sometimes play hours of RDR2. Maybe the game just delivers the much need escapism I sometimes need.

The one creative thing I’ve been working on lately was SoaPatrickEight which started as a quite promising new idea and then decided to stick with incremental updates to my SoaPatrick themes.

early design idea for SoaPatrickEight

This is a rough version of the idea I had for **SoaPatrickEight**, and I still might end up with that version someday but for now, SoaPatrickEight will look similar to [SoaPatrickSeven](https://www.soapatrick.com/factory/soapatrickseven/) with some smaller changes based on ideas I had for SoaPatrickEight. I think I just didn’t have the will, energy, and time to make a bigger structural change to my site because what is visible now is the result of an idea that started two and a half years ago with [SoaPatrickFive](https://www.soapatrick.com/factory/soapatrickfive/). I’ve been perfecting that theme ever since, so changing everything is kinda like looking up a huge mountain and realizing what a steep and long climb that will be and I’m too tired for that right now.

I know I sound really depressed but I’m just tired (will be going to bed right after I publish this) and there’s no need for me to worry, just speaking my mind.

So what's the take away from today's post? I think writing a lot more again might be therapeutical, it once put me back on track and helped me get more creative, so maybe I have to put out my thoughts and hit the keyboard a lot more often.

Please don’t judge this post to harshly, I’m not sure it all made sense and I’m sure there are some grammatically weird sentences and I’m not even going to go through the text again to find them, so if you find some you can keep them. Me? I’m off to bed now, see you tomorrow.
