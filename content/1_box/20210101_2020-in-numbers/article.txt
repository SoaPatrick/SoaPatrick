Old: Last year I (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2020/01/2019-in-numbers/ text: wrote target: _blank) a short post about some numbers from 2019 and I thought I keep this tradition because it's always fun to look back and see how I stack up compared to previous years.

So here are last years numbers:

- I wrote 54 Blog posts (11â€™664 words)
- I shot and finished ONE Movie (started more though)
- I posted 8 Fotos on Instagram
- I watched 120 Movies
- I watched 208+ TV Episodes

Some notes on those numbers. I increased the number of Blog posts, which is nice and I also wrote over 2000 words more than in 2019. On the other hand, I only shot (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/2020/05/race-a-short-blender-animation/ text: one movie target: _blank) (though at least it was a fully animated one) and I only posted 8 images on Instagram. About that, I feel like leaving Instagram as well after I deleted Facebook from my iPhone and never really logged in on my Mac after that.

I did watch more movies and decreased the number of watched TV Show Episodes which is something I've actually wanted to do, so good for me.

All in all, it was a productive year when you consider the circumstances. Hopefully, I can increase certain things this year, but I will go into further details about my plans in another post.
