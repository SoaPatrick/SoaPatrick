Old: Last [year](https://www.soapatrick.com/2020/01/some-thoughts-on-2019/) I started with a different kind of look back or recap on the previous year, no more top ten lists but rather an unsorted or alphabetical list of things I liked and didn't quite like. And also some notes on stuff I did.

The idea was to summarize and categorize the year quickly in good and bad stuff with some noteworthy things. So like [yesterday](https://www.soapatrick.com/2021/01/2020-in-numbers/)'s post, I will keep this tradition and do the same thing again with 2020.

## Things I liked

- **Better Call Saul**, the fifth season is the best new thing on TV I've seen all year. The last three episodes were absolute nailbiters.
- **[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)**, this free tool allowed me to be able to create anything from nothing in 3D, which really lifted my spirit.
- **Firefox**, this is my go-to browser on all my devices now and I'm glad I made the switch to a browser that I believe actually cares about privacy.
- **Good movies from 2019**, I finally came around to seeing some missed good movies from 2019 like Ford vs Ferrari and Knives Out.
- [**Jelle’s Marble Runs**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYJdpnjuSWVOLgGT9fIzL0g), another uplifting thing that replaced all the sporting events that were canceled. I never thought marbles could deliver so much joy.
- **Mank**, a new movie by David Fincher is always something special. Seeing it on the big screen even more special. Not his best film but certainly his most beautiful.
- **Old movies**, saw some older movies again, due to a lack of new releases, which reminded me of better times.
- **Red Dead Redemption 2**, is something I was addicted to and delivered much-needed escapism.
- **Streamers**, Netflix really benefited in times of a Pandemic and released new content constantly, I loved it.
- **The Social Dilemma**, this docu on Netflix was the final thing that I needed to go through avoiding (but not yet deleting) Facebook and rethink my use of social media.
- **Trump losing**, seeing him finally losing was a huge relief.
- **Uplifting movies**, in dire times it's important to lift oneself up, especially in a year like last year. Movies that lifted me up were Palm Springs, Bill & Ted Face the Music or Soul.

## Things I didn’t like

- **Cats**, every year there are bad movies and I've seen quite a few but nothing was as bad as this one.
- **Conspiracy Theorists**, these annoy the hell out of me and I don't quite understand how to deal with them.
- **Corona (COVID-19)**, what is there to say, is the world reacting to our overpopulation? Is this just the beginning? I don't know.
- **People who think they know better than scientists**, another group of people that annoy me, especially in a year like last year.
- **Unfinished Projects**, I started a few new short projects again this year and never finishing them, this has to stop, or at least get better.
- **YouTube**, as much as I love YouTube, the service has become really bad this year with the constant ad-breaks. Plus I've been watching too much of it, well it was a weird year.

## What else did I do?

- Build my own gaming/Blender PC
- Used the free time I got to learn Blender again
- Released two themes (SP7 and SP8)
- Continued again with walking through every street in Basel
- Started to Vlog privately
- Improved my photography skills
