I do a lot then there\u2019s a personal issue which I might go into further details another day. But this post is about the creative work I do on a regular basis.<\/p><p>Usually, every creative project gets sent to the factory where it\u2019s displayed in all its glory, but not everything I do is factory-ready, some stuff is just me playing around in the lab and creating all kinds of different stuff. And sometimes I just wanna display this stuff (I kinda avoid putting that stuff on Instagram, because I wanna keep control of my work and not hand over some rights to Facebook) and not write a blog post about it.<\/p><p>So I created a new section here called <a href=\"\/lab\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SoapLab<\/a>. There every small thing I\u2019ve done (currently mainly Blender stuff) gets shown, no single page with more info, no tag sorting mechanism, just a wall of my work with a lightbox function to see it in its full glory.<\/p><p>So head over there (link of course also in the navigation) and take a look\u2026<\/p>"},"id":"93fa4034-8a8d-4d74-bce1-634c58af92a8","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
