Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Yes, I\u2019ve started work on SoaPatrickNine and I\u2019ve come quite far with\n my first coding session. Now I don\u2019t use an app like Photoshop or \nsomething like Adobe XD, Figma, or Sketch. I use my coding editor and do\n something which is called \u2018design by coding\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far I\u2019ve written very hacky code but it\u2019s more important on how it\n looks than how it\u2019s coded. Once I nailed down the look of the design I \nwill write a new theme. Yes even though SP9 will be more of an iteration\n of SP8, I plan on writing everything from the ground up. This gives me a\n chance to optimize the code once more because there is always stuff to \noptimize.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I don\u2019t want to define a release date, but I hope that by mid-may\n (end of may the latest) I will have some sort of version to be \nreleasable. It will bring with it some structural changes, but I look \nforward to it, I like what I\u2019ve made so far.<\/p>"},"id":"30886866-4078-4364-bdab-6807c8b05884","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
