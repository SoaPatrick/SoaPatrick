Old: It's been one hell of a busy week but I made so much progress with SoaPatrickNine that I think it's ready to be released very soon. It's been a blast to start from scratch and actually reduce code and optimize the theme once again. It will be different but at the same time it's similar, but I think visually it's a big improvement on SoaPatrickEight.

So I will rest my eyes a bit...
