Gone are few \nthings and I streamlined a lot of code in the back and I think the \nperformance got even better.

There are some pages with \nspecific color themes. The Lab for example has a dark mode with pink \ninstead of red. The Patrick page comes in full red and the privacy page \nin full black. I thought this gives the pages a nice touch and \ndistinctions itself from the rest of the page. But yeah red is back!<\/p>"},"id":"28134a7f-8d24-48b7-86e1-820951ff4300","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"No sidebar"},"id":"bb1c401d-2711-49ed-be49-bbf1468507e7","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Gone is the sidebar which usually displayed related content, I always\n had an idea to use more space in the horizontal direction but in the \nend, it started to bother me how it looked and at some point, when the \nscreen became too small, it was at the bottom anyway. So I got rid of \nit, makes it cleaner and no more strange color bars depending on your \nscreen size.<\/p>"},"id":"005eb8b6-1a8d-431e-acd0-af1ab66e99f5","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"New landingpage"},"id":"5b444eeb-d9f0-4614-b197-cc82e65510af","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The landing page is now showing the latest posts from the Box, the \nLab, and the Factory because sometimes I don\u2019t want to write a new blog \nentry but show my last work from the lab, and this way the website \nalways shows something new, regardless of what contest it is. There\u2019s \nalso a feed at the bottom which includes my last seen movies which I \nlogged on <a href=\"https:\/\/letterboxd.com\/soapatrick\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Letterboxd<\/a>.<\/p> <p>This means the actual blog now moved to the subpage box, and all \nblogposts have a new URL. I know this sucks because google has already \ncrawled all my blog posts (probably) and now they all need to be \nrecrawled but honestly, who has found this page through a google search.<\/p>"},"id":"8f0680d2-758e-482b-977d-5fac40f45f58","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"What else is coming"},"id":"31bd5d41-68df-4743-93fc-5a478c7c6ebe","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>As always, when I release a new theme I have some ideas on what to \nchange, include or remove further down the road, and with SoaPatrickNine\n it\u2019s no different. I have an idea for some soapy graphics to include \nand because I have fixed color schemes, I want to try to include some 3D\n graphics as well. There\u2019s also an idea in my head of an animated SP \nLogo somewhere.<\/p> <p>I also want to include a quick button for RSS feeds for the \nindividual post types. Maybe someone just wants to subscribe to the Lab \nor the Factory, who knows.<\/p> <p>I might also play around with some icons and how they are displayed \n(especially for the individual blog posts) and maybe come up with a more\n compact list view for related stuff.<\/p>"},"id":"22b2220a-3829-4577-8bcc-1b73b30175fa","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"The road to 10"},"id":"a9cf31d2-b589-404d-b103-9db7b789ddc9","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Yes, this is version nine, and usually, a version sticks around for \naround 8 months which means a new version should be finished by the end \nof the year, oh man the pressure already.
