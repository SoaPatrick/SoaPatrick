Old: It happens quite a lot that I can't remember when I did a certain thing, like build my PC. So I come here and use the search and the date of the blog post tells me when that happened. I realized that this website is kinda like a diary for me and that doesn't bother me at all.

I know that I will never be able to publish real personal stuff here, after all, it's the open web. I will never mention any of my friends' names or go into very specific details but I think writing down some of my thoughts can be helpful and might be interesting to look back to sometime in the future.

With every new SP theme, I tend to go through old blog posts to check if there are some design flaws, and every time I stumble upon some old entries which put a smile on my face. There are also some draft posts which I plan on finishing soon which reflect on some personal subjects.

So what I'm trying to say is that I should keep this up, be more personal again, and maybe be that more often.
