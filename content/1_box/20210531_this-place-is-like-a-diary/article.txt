Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>It happens quite a lot that I can\u2019t remember when I did a certain \nthing, like build my PC. So I come here and use the search and the date \nof the blog post tells me when that happened. I realized that this \nwebsite is kinda like a diary for me and that doesn\u2019t bother me at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that I will never be able to publish real personal stuff here,\n after all, it\u2019s the open web. I will never mention any of my friends\u2019 \nnames or go into very specific details but I think writing down some of \nmy thoughts can be helpful and might be interesting to look back to \nsometime in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With every new SP theme, I tend to go through old blog posts to check\n if there are some design flaws, and every time I stumble upon some old \nentries which put a smile on my face. There are also some draft posts \nwhich I plan on finishing soon which reflect on some personal subjects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I\u2019m trying to say is that I should keep this up, be more personal again, and maybe be that more often.<\/p>"},"id":"ad92719b-b714-4370-b92f-e35e28391b4d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
