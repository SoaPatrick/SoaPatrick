Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I\u2019ve been doing a lot of apartment stuff in Blender for other people \nand because of that, I learned a lot, and then I thought I could reapply\n all those things I\u2019ve learned to my own apartment. So I started from \nscratch, use the old apartment only for measurement and build all the \nwalls now with planes, and used more boolean modifiers.<\/p> <p>The result is a much more clean-looking apartment structure that is \neasier to modify and change. I copied over some of the furniture from \nthe bar and others I plan on doing completely new. Especially the couch.<\/p>"},"id":"7e355767-229b-4ac8-b3fa-97097f90952a","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["apartment.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"true","ratio":"","crop":"false","align":"default"},"id":"fe5c3b5f-01ff-4f16-8048-e6fc7f17122c","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Last two weeks I focused a lot on my office room and my workspace because I\u2019m having this idea of updating my main workspace and what better way to try out some stuff and see if everything looks good in Blender. The idea is to buy a new monitor stand so I can have the screens further back than I currently have, and also have them more in line with my eyesight. I would also love to buy new speakers and clean the desk up and free it from all the clutter so that I have more room when I do something else than working on my mac. The idea is to have the actual Mac Mini inside an Ikea Billy shelf next to the desk and everything connected via thunderbolt to a hub. The monitors are connected via thunderbolt to the hub and the <a href=\"https:\/\/audioengineusa.com\/shop\/poweredspeakers\/a5-plus-classic-speakers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Audioengine A5+<\/a> speakers via <a href=\"https:\/\/audioengineusa.com\/shop\/components\/d1-24-bit-dacheadphone-amp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DAC<\/a> (which is located below the desk and accessible from the front) as well.<\/p><p>With that setup, I could potentially connect a future work laptop (please Apple, release a new MacBook Pro on Monday) easily with the thunderbolt hub and start working with the same video\/audio configuration. The whole camera and microphone for vlogging is a different thing and something I\u2019m not quite sure yet how to solve, I have some ideas but it would need a different and more expensive hub or they are purely connected to the Mac Mini and not to a laptop.<\/p><p>I would love to have the speakers on shelves to make room on the desk and I thought a shelf in the middle would make it possible to store other stuff. There\u2019s an idea to put all my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lego.com\/de-de\/search?q=helm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lego Star Wars helmets<\/a> up there, that would look sweet.<\/p>"},"id":"763c3076-1617-4df5-97ba-1c99f51d49f3","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"align":"default","location":"kirby","video":["apartment-video.mp4"],"url":"","caption":""},"id":"ba7e03b9-eb14-4717-9f91-7c9b683a508b","isHidden":false,"type":"video"},{"content":{"text":"<p>All in all, I love how it looks, now I can start planning to put this thing together in real life. I was really surprised how fast I created certain things in Blender, the Ikea shelf was fun to do, same with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dell.com\/de-ch\/shop\/dell-monitorarm-f%C3%BCr-zwei-bildschirme-mda20\/apd\/482-bbdl\/monitore-und-monitorzubeh%C3%B6r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dell MDA20 Monitor stand<\/a> and try out different monitor positions. Also, the Ikea desk chair was put together really fast. I\u2019ve learned so much again over the last few weeks that I start to create more complex things, I just wish time wouldn\u2019t fly that fast when I\u2019m blendering.<\/p>"},"id":"ea8180a5-e529-4f61-85ce-f5dd47b4fa70","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
