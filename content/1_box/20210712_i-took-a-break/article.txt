I used this time to do other stuff, \nlike catch up on some movies or TV Shows, did try out some games, and \nmade some purchases like a VR Headset.<\/p> <p>Now I\u2019m on a break from work (my first since October 2020) and one of\n my goals for this week is to get back to some stuff that was sidelined.\n And maybe share my thoughts on the world of VR and how I\u2019m now able to \nwalk around in my 3D creations done in Blender.<\/p> <p>But for today, I want to leave with a quote from Roger Waters from an\n Interview for the documentary on one of my favorite albums and one of \nmy absolute favorite songs: <strong>Wish you were here<\/strong><\/p>"},"id":"9e75e598-af3d-4fa9-84d8-2731ddcca153","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"Can you free yourself enough to be able to experience the reality of life as it goes on before you and with you, and as you go on as part of it or not?
