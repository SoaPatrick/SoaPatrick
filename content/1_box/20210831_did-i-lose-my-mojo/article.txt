Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>It\u2019s been such a long time since I\u2019m posted anything and what kinda \nbugs me is that I\u2019ve had multiple moments where I felt like I could post\n something about this or that but every time I\u2019ve chosen the consuming \nway and watch something on TV instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many things I kinda want to do but then not really. Like\n doing something with React or Vue, working on SPX and try out Tailwind,\n getting into Unreal Engine with its amazing new release 5, or work on \nmy new possible short film by designing the set in Blender. But none of \nthis happened and instead, I watched a lot of content, either on YouTube\n or just some movies and TV shows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a longer break in October and hopefully, I will find my mojo \nagain so that I do creative work again because I have some ideas on what\n I want to do and I don\u2019t want to spend my vacation in front of the TV \nand consume even more content.<\/p>"},"id":"525d86ff-97a3-4b47-bb97-584545f83d29","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
