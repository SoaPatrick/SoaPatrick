Old: It's been such a long time since I'm posted anything and what kinda bugs me is that I've had multiple moments where I felt like I could post something about this or that but every time I've chosen the consuming way and watch something on TV instead.

There are so many things I kinda want to do but then not really. Like doing something with React or Vue, working on SPX and try out Tailwind, getting into Unreal Engine with its amazing new release 5, or work on my new possible short film by designing the set in Blender. But none of this happened and instead, I watched a lot of content, either on YouTube or just some movies and TV shows.

I have a longer break in October and hopefully, I will find my mojo again so that I do creative work again because I have some ideas on what I want to do and I don't want to spend my vacation in front of the TV and consume even more content.
