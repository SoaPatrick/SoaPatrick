Old: I've decided to leave WordPress as my CMS and move over to (link: https://getkirby.com/ text: Kirby target: _blank), a flat-file CMS. I've been using WordPress for a LOOOOOOONG time, so this wasn't an easy decision, and it sure wasn't a decision that was made in a haste or quickly. I thought long and hard about this and after some testing and looking at other options, weighing pros and cons I came to the conclusion, that it was time to move to something new.

The main reason I looked for alternatives was Gutenberg. Now I love the new (it's not really that new anymore) Gutenberg editor but things move so fast with WordPress and with each version Gutenberg gets new features and now even full site editing that it's hard to keep up with these changes. And since I hardly use any of the new features they are cluttering up my editor more and more. Plus tailoring WordPress for my needs is also getting more and more complex and frankly, I don't have the time.

So I looked (link: https://www.soapatrick.com/box/2021/10/switching-cms/ text: around target: _blank), looked at what the world out there is offering in terms of CMS and I tested quite a few and got some cool new insights into new technologies. For a short time, I thought about going full dev mode and use (link: https://gohugo.io/ text: Hugo target: _blank), a Static Site Generator, as my CMS. With Hugo, you only work inside a Code Editor, write Markdown files and deliver static files, no CMS no nothing. It was really tempting but at the end of the day I'm a very visual person and I love myself some GUI.

So now it's Kirby, a very lightweight fully customizable CMS from a very small and sympathetic Company in Germany. It will take some time and good planning to make this switch (especially for all the content to be migrated over) and it will come with a new design, SoaPatrickTen will be featured on Kirby, that I can promise.
