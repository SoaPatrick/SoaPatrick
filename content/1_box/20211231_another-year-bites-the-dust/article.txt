Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>It\u2019s been another weird year with many ups and downs, both personally\n and for the whole world. When I wrote on this day a year ago that the \nnext year will be different then I could repeat myself again and \nhopefully this time I\u2019m right. I just hope the world goes back to some \nsort of normal. It was interesting at first to have all those \nrestrictions but now it\u2019s just annoying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will write some more in the new year with some ideas and some plans, and also with a look back, But for now\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2026see you all on the other side.<\/p>"},"id":"c883bc93-58aa-4a8d-ac13-5e9635bccb32","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
