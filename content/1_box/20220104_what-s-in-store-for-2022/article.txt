Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>For the past two years I started each year the same, first I run some\n numbers from the previous year, then I look at what I liked and what I \ndidn\u2019t like and finally I try to look forward, give a preview of what \nthis place can expect the following 12 months.<\/p> <p>When I go back to those posts and read the plan and compare it to \nwhat has actually come to fruition, I get sad because not much of those \nthings have been happening. Should I change that? Should I not make bold\n claims about what I plan on doing? Well, I think having an idea or a \nplan or better yet goals is always good. It gives me a path to follow. \nSo I will once again outline some work goals I set for myself.<\/p> <p>There are of course also more personal goals, but I will talk about \nthose probably another time because it needs a bit more context.<\/p>"},"id":"ab03d30d-f7af-4beb-9850-c98083290705","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"SoaPatrickTen and Kirby"},"id":"396c90e1-231c-4fa5-a74b-53d94ac3db1b","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I\u2019ve mentioned this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.soapatrick.com\/box\/2021\/11\/its-kirby-time\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">before<\/a>\n and I\u2019m still working on this, even though it doesn\u2019t seem like it \nbecause I never provided a status update. But yes I\u2019m hard at work at \none part of this goal, and I\u2019m making good progress. Nevertheless, the \ngoal is to release either a modified SP9 on Kirby or a full new SP10 on \nKirby in the next\u2026 let me think\u2026 next two months.<\/p> <p>The biggest hurdle from the Kirby side is the migration and on the \nSP10 it\u2019s the creative process of coming up with a new design. But I \nwant this to be done, sooner rather than later so that I can focus on \nother things.<\/p>"},"id":"f6c6a83e-0a4a-4697-9a3f-0ca3d3708f87","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Making Videos"},"id":"092af3fd-68b1-46cd-90ac-4e2f75e7843d","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I\u2019m not calling it short films or microfilms or something else, but \nvideos. Because at the end of the day they are all videos and don\u2019t need\n an exact label. The point is I want to make some videos this year and I\n want to combine it with Blender and maybe even Unreal Engine 5 because \nit\u2019s something that interests me and combining things I like to do seems\n kinda obvious.<\/p> <p>Now I\u2019m calling it videos because I\u2019m not sure if they will have \nstories or if it\u2019s just moving pictures because if there is a hurdle I\u2019m\n having, it\u2019s coming up with stories that are doable with my resources.<\/p>"},"id":"d232a43e-b2ef-4375-94b8-ffd07c3a2764","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Lab and Factory"},"id":"640f1971-c4db-4c39-9163-f55720c98aef","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>In my yearly look back in numbers, I always check how many \u2018movies\u2019 \nI\u2019ve made and it seems kinda unfair to only check for those when there \nis other stuff I usually do during the span of 12 months. So my goal is \nto create a lot more for the lab and the factory so that by the end of \nthe year I find myself with a nice collection of creative output that I \ncan be proud of.<\/p>"},"id":"bd07c3ba-596e-4a20-9692-2cb86f6bd223","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"To conclude"},"id":"ba553c4f-746b-4302-b97a-5ebf70e17fdf","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I know that it\u2019s much broader this year but that\u2019s deliberate because\n I don\u2019t want to push myself into a corner, let\u2019s just take baby steps \nand once I got the grove I can increase the tempo. I think the important\n thing to take with me from last year, because I didn\u2019t really live by \nit, is:<\/p>"},"id":"c5a1545c-ca75-4e5c-a6b3-c1a4a0a1cbcd","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Be more focused<\/p>","citation":"","style":"large"},"id":"f8c3e3f3-beb2-4c08-9595-c064315aa26d","isHidden":false,"type":"quote"},{"content":{"text":"<p>It might be easy for some but for me, I have to put in a lot more \neffort, but I realized that last year and hopefully this leads to \nactually living it.<\/p> <p>There will be a follow-up with some things I would like to do on a more personal side but that\u2019s a whole other beast.<\/p>"},"id":"ac218514-99e9-4443-b921-18066eb9ad92","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
