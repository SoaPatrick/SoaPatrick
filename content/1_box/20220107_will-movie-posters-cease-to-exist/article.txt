Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I recently noticed something while browsing through Disney+ and \nNetflix, they don\u2019t display the movies with their corresponding Posters.\n What you get instead are stills from the movie in a 16 by 9 ratio. And \nthe images they chose to represent the movies are odd. I\u2019m sure there is\n some analytics behind this where it tells Netflix what movies people \ndecided to watch based on what image is being shown. But still, \nsometimes it shows a character which is hardly in a movie but maybe the \nactor is famous. This is pretty misleading as it might disappoint \ncertain people. But like I said, I\u2019m sure there is a reason for these \ndecisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what really bothers me is that we don\u2019t get to see the actual \nmovie poster. Now I know that not all posters these days are actually \ngood, most are rather generic looking and bland but still. Movie posters\n are, after all, an art form. But with cinemas closing left and right, \npeople watching movies mostly at home through streaming services, and \nDVDs or Blu-rays slowly fading away it begs the question, where will we \nsee movie posters in the future?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love my small collection of <a href=\"https:\/\/wall.soapatrick.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">movie posters<\/a>\n and I love my wall with four frames that allow me to switch posters \nfrom the front and I would be sad if this art form will be non-existence\n in a few years and all we see is a movie still with the title written \non it while we browse through any streaming service on our couch and \nchoose the title based on the good looking actor or the catchy title.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m wrong\u2026<\/p>"},"id":"098877f5-4308-46f4-a64d-627394488077","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
