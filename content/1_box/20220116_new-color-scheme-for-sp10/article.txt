Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Back in <a href=\"\/box\/a-new-color-scheme-for-a-new-theme\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2018<\/a>, I had the urge to change the look and feel of my website, back then the red theme was born. I always like this slightly dirty red with a very dark gray as a contrast color. With this color scheme, I did <a href=\"\/factory\/soapatrickfive\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SP5<\/a>, <a href=\"\/factory\/soapatricksix\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SP6<\/a>, <a href=\"\/factory\/soapatrickseven\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SP7<\/a>, SP8, and finally SP9. All with this Red and Gray combo (and sometimes with additional colors variations to offer the theme option).<\/p><p>During my design process for SP10 in which I used Adobe XD for the very first time (but I will get to that later) I noticed that I need more colors. All my previous designs consisted mainly of 3 colors: primary color, dark color, and white. But with just three colors I was always limited in my designs, just like I was now.<\/p><p>It was time to open up the color spectrum and look for a way to incorporate more colors and through that open up some design possibilities. So I hoped over to <a href=\"https:\/\/color.adobe.com\/de\/create\/color-wheel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adobe Color<\/a> and played around with some colors, looked through other peoples color schemes, and in the end, I came up with the following:<\/p>"},"id":"560acca2-b11a-410f-b3cc-57c38a0f7621","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["sp10-color-scheme-1.png"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"false","ratio":"","crop":"false","shadow":"true","align":"default"},"id":"78660f1f-f633-4c80-9ce4-f0870627a9b7","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>With that color scheme, I was able to finish the structure I was building with Adobe XD and give it a new Paint. Usually, I\u2019m a <a href=\"\/box\/sp9-is-in-development\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">design by coding<\/a> kinda guy but in the past, I noticed that it takes a lot of time to play around with different variations. So I thought I try out Adobe XD and I was amazed how quickly I had all these ideas I had floating in my head put down visually. This process speed everything up and within a few days, I had a new design iteration.<\/p><p>I say iteration because as always I\u2019m not the guy who creates complete new designs. Usually, I just tweak a few things here and there, sometimes more sometimes less, and take with me what worked and abandon what didn\u2019t.<\/p><p>Now I\u2019m not going to show the design just yet, because I\u2019m I think the release of it is not too far away and I don\u2019t want to spoil the surprise, but I want to end today\u2019s post with the logo in its new color scheme:<\/p>"},"id":"2e5aedf4-7fba-449a-b418-62d623f7e3aa","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["sp10-color-scheme-2.png"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","lightbox":"false","ratio":"","crop":"false","shadow":"true","align":"default"},"id":"23198c1d-58d5-4f41-9979-951c45ac81de","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}]
