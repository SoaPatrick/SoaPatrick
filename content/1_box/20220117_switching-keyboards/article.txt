Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I\u2019ve made a bold move recently, I\u2019ve started using a US keyboard. But let\u2019s go back just a bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I watch a lot of Youtube content and sooner or later, as someone who \nwatches a lot of gadget or gear channels, you stumble upon a video where\n someone mentions a mechanical keyboard. I must admit, they look amazing\n and so I\u2019ve started to watch more of those videos and was sucked into \nthe endless possibilities of mechanical keyboards with their custom \nswitches and custom keycaps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the hard truth is that if you\u2019re living in Switzerland and on top\n of that are using a Mac you\u2019re fucked when it comes to mechanical \nkeyboards and especially keycaps. No one really cares about ISO Swiss \nlayouts, so there was really only one way to go\u2026 all in with a US \nkeyboard and pretty much relearn everything I\u2019ve learned the last, oh I \ndon\u2019t know\u2026 20 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for ten days now I\u2019ve been rocking a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.keychron.com\/products\/keychron-k6-non-backlight-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=39431214104665\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Keychron K6<\/a>\n and I think I\u2019m getting better at typing regular text but the real pain\n right now is writing code, all those special characters you need for \nwriting HTML and CSS are on different keys. But if I don\u2019t keep on doing\n what I\u2019m doing now I can\u2019t get any better so I will stick with it. And \nas proof that I\u2019m really sticking with it is the fact that I ordered two\n sets of keycaps, one Cherry and one XDA because I really think that \nlower profile keycaps will be more suitable for me. And on top of that, I\n also ordered myself the new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.keychron.com\/products\/keychron-q2-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard?variant=39610691125337\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Keychron Q2 with a Knob<\/a>, why you ask? Well because I cannot write at work on a normal Swiss keyboard, I will need a US keyboard now everywhere!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you may call me crazy but sometimes you take huge burdens on \nyourself just to have something cool even if it takes a while until you \nfully can enjoy it, plus US keyboards are MADE for writing code, all the\n special characters are located on better-suited keys anyway.<\/p>"},"id":"bb9eb7fe-f562-43ed-a538-eb9b7b340c63","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
