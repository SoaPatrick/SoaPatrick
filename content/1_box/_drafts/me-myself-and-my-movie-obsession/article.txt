Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Many people call me the human movie dictionary, which of course is an exaggeration, I can\u2018t know it all and often I don\u2018t but I do know <strong>some<\/strong> stuff. So I thought I go back to the beginning and describe how it all started.<\/p><p>My first memory of me going to the movies was with E.T. I don\u2018t remember all the details but I remember that I cried a lot, that movie still touches me today. But to say that this experience triggered it all would be wrong. It was just a movie for me back then. I do think a big part had my Uncle though. Let me explain, I used to spend lots of weekends at his place, playing games, listening to Music and watching Movies and I\u2019m talking about Movies a kid my age wasn\u2018t supposed to see. I remember watching The Terminator, Jaws, Suspiria, and Evil Dead among others. Well, watching parts of them, most of the time I was covering my eyes. But those movies, classics in their individual field, had a big influence on me.<\/p><p>Of course, those weren\u2019t the only movies I\u2018ve seen and not everything was too brutal for me, there were also lots of classics and more family-friendly Movies. There\u2018s one specific example I remember fondly. It was the Summer of 1987 and I was staying in a hotel in Florida with my mother my uncle and his wife. I was 8 years old, I couldn\u2018t speak or understand English but there I was, sitting on the floor with my eyes glued to the screen and watching Return of the Jedi. The Vader reveal scene is to this day burned into my eyes, I was in awe.<\/p><p>Image of Vader reveal<\/p><p>I think moments like these really had a big impact on me because they showed me the magic of moving images, I mean I was able to follow the plot without understanding the spoken words. But all these experiences were had because my family showed me movies, I didn\u2018t really discover them myself. All this changed in 1994, at least that\u2018s how I remember it. I started to buy the German Movie Magazin \u201aCinema\u2018 regularly and with True Lies and Speed, two Blockbuster movies from that year, I was hooked. In 1996 I\u2018ve seen close to 100 movies at the cinema, not counting all the movies I\u2018ve seen at home, so I\u2019d say there the movie Obsession was born.<\/p><p>Those were the days where I also wanted to make my own movies, so I wrote my own stories, but I never really found a crazy enough friend who would actually put those Ideas and scripts into actual movies. It was and still is a profession that requires more than just yourself. The scripts weren\u2018t good or very original but that\u2018s beside the point, I wrote like crazy, and I didn\u2018t stand in my way and demand perfection, I just wrote because I loved it and wanted to tell stories.<\/p><p>But somewhere down the road, the magic was lost or maybe because none of the written stories turned into a filmed project (with very few exceptions) and that started to bother me because I wanted to create stuff. So my focus shifted to the web and making homepages. First with a Jennifer Love Hewitt Fanpage (The Love Corner) and then to Winona Ryder and And God Created Noni which became the biggest Winona fan page for a few years. It was fun doing something and seeing the result and people reacting to your work,<\/p><p>Image from the Insider?<\/p><p>But even though I didn\u2018t write or shoot any movies I still consumed them like crazy. But the difference being I never really invested time to learn the craft, I guess it was more of a gut feeling when I wrote or shot a certain way (You could say I\u2018m more of a learn-by-doing-it kinda guy).<\/p><p>But why am I so obsessed with Movies and creating my own? Or better yet Storytelling with moving Images? (Just to be broader, since TV Shows are where the really good stories are nowadays). I think on one hand it\u2018s just the medium that speaks to me the most, certain movies have changed my life for the better (The Breakfast Club or Fight Club for example), and I\u2018m a sucker for good stories. On the other hand, I\u2018m fascinated by the craft since the first time I tried to make my own video, the possibility to make something that connects with your viewers, is an amazing feeling.<\/p><p>A few years ago I actually started to get more interested in the craft of writing screenplays and decided to read \u201aStory by Robert McKee\u2018, a fascinating read. One of the first things the book tells you is that just because you\u2018ve seen a lot of movies doesn\u2018t mean you know how to write a proper story. I guess I should have read that book back in 1996.<\/p><p>With the rise of YouTube and accessible and cheaper Movie Equipment, new possibilities have emerged and you can\u2018t really blame anything else other than your own lack of ambition. So now It\u2018s time to take that movie Obsession and do something concrete with it, no more whining, no more sitting around and brooding, now it\u2018s time to act! I\u2018m talking to myself here by the way.<\/p>"},"id":"af4365d6-9f93-4551-9fc3-91b1dcbc7941","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
