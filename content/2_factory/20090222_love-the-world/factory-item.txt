I created two different designs with the first one displaying a very detailed route which turned out to be too detailed. For the second design idea, I simplified the route by just giving a general idea of where he\u2019s going through and giving it a more sleek look. In the end, none of it was used because of the growing popularity of Facebook which allowed them to inform friends of their whereabouts more directly without them having to visit a different website.<\/p>"},"id":"2fba8cb1-f77c-4f21-afc4-d773f4f3896d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
